</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">With</span> the present collection the publication of
Sumner’s Essays comes to an end. The original
project of publishers and editor contemplated but a single
volume—“War and Other Essays”—and they accordingly
equipped that volume with a bibliography which
was as complete as they then could make it. But when,
later on, other materials came to be known about, and
especially after the discovery of a number of unpublished
manuscripts, the encouraging reception accorded to
the first venture led us to publish a second, and then a
third collection: “Earth Hunger and Other Essays” and
“The Challenge of Facts and Other Essays.” It was
during the preparation of the latter of these, now some
five years ago, that the late Professor Callender deplored to
the editor the omission of certain of Sumner’s essays in
political economy—in particular those dealing with free
trade and sound money. And the reviewers of preceding
collections had reminded us, rightly enough, that there
should be a fuller bibliography and also an index covering
all the essays.</p>

<p>In this last volume we have striven to meet these several
suggestions and criticisms. And it is now the purpose of
the publishers to form of these singly issued volumes a set
of four, numbered in the order of their issue. Since the
series could not have been planned as such at the outset,
this purpose is in the nature of an after-thought; and there
is therefore no general organization or systematic classification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
by volumes. In so far as classification is possible,
under the circumstances, it is made by way of the index.
This and the bibliography are the work of Dr. M. R. Davie;
and are but a part of the service he has performed in the
interest of an intellectual master whom he could know only
through the printed word and the medium of another man.</p>

<p>Sumner’s dominant interest in political economy, as
revealed in his teaching and writing, issued in a doughty
advocacy of “free trade and hard money,” and involved
the relentless exposure of protectionism and of schemes
of currency-debasement. As conveying his estimate of
protectionism, it is only fitting that his little book on “The
-Ism which teaches that Waste makes Wealth” should
be recalled from an obscurity that it does not deserve; it
is typical of the author’s most vigorous period and witnesses
to the acerbity of a former issue that may recur.
In default of a single, comprehensive companion-piece in
the field of finance, and one making as interesting reading,
it has been necessary to confine selection to several
rather brief articles, most of them dating from the campaign
of 1896. In the choice of all economic essays I
have been guided by the advice of my colleague, Professor
F. R. Fairchild, a fellow-student under Sumner and a
fellow-admirer of his character and career. Professor S.
L. Mims also has been generous in his aid. I do not
need to thank either of these men, for what they did was
a labor of gratitude and love.</p>

<p>The title essay will be found at the end of the volume.
It is the once-famous lecture on “The Forgotten Man,”
and is here printed for the first time. When “War and
Other Essays” was being prepared, we had no knowledge
of the existence of this manuscript lecture; and, in order
to bring into what we supposed was to be a one-volume
collection this character-creation of Sumner’s, one
often alluded to in modern writings, we reprinted two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
chapters from “What Social Classes Owe to Each Other.”
It has been found impracticable in later reprintings of
Vol. I to replace those chapters with the more complete
essay; and we have therefore decided to reproduce the
latter, despite the certain degree of repetition involved,
rather than leave it out of the series. In view of the fact
that Sumner has been more widely known, perhaps, as
the creator and advocate of the “Forgotten Man,” than
as the author of any other of his works, we entitle this
volume “The Forgotten Man and Other Essays.”</p>

<p>Several essays not of an economic order have been included
because they have come to my knowledge within
the last few years and have seemed to me to call for preservation.
It is almost impossible to fix the dates of such
manuscript essays, for I have not been able in all cases to
secure information from persons who might be able to
identify times and occasions. And there remain a good
number of articles and manuscripts, published or unpublished,
which can receive no more than mention, with a
word of characterization, in the bibliography.</p>

<p>Some mention ought to be made here of a large body of
hand-written manuscript left by Sumner and representing
the work of several years—1899 to 1905 or thereabouts—upon
a systematic treatise on “The Science of Society.”
Printed as it was left, partially and unevenly completed
and with many small and some wide hiatuses, this manuscript
would make several substantial volumes. It is a
monument of industry, involving, as it did, the collection
over many years of thousands of notes and memoranda,
and the extraction from the same, by a sort of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tour de force</i>,
of generalizations intended to be set forth, with the support
of copious evidence, in the form of a survey of the
evolution and life of human society. These manuscripts,
as left, represent no more than a preliminary survey of a
wide field, together with more elaborately worked out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
chartings of sections of that field. The author planned
to re-write the whole in the light of “Folkways.” The continuation,
modification, and completion of this enterprise,
in something approaching the form contemplated by its
author, must needs be, if at all possible, a long task.</p>

<p>As one surveys, through these volumes of essays, the
various phases of scholarly and literary activity of their
author, and then recalls the teaching, both extensive and
intensive, done by him with such unremitting devotion
to what he regarded as his first duty—and when one
thinks, yet again, of his labors in connection with college
and university administration, with the Connecticut State
Board of Education, and in other lines—it is hard to understand
where one man got the time, with all his ability
and energy, to accomplish all this. In the presence of evidence
of such incessant and unswerving industry, scarcely
interrupted by the ill-health that overtook Sumner at
about the age of fifty, an ordinary person feels a sense
of oppression and of bewilderment, and is almost willing
to subscribe to the old, hopeless tradition that “there were
giants in those days.”</p>

<p>In the preparation of this set of books the editor has been
constantly sustained and encouraged by the interest and
sympathy of the woman who stood by the author’s side
through life, and to whom anything that had to do with the
preservation of his memory was thereby just, perfect, and
altogether praiseworthy. The completion of this editorial
task would be the more satisfying if she were still among
us to receive the final offering.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">During</span> the last fifteen years we have had two great
questions to discuss: the restoration of the currency
and civil-service reform. Neither of these questions has yet
reached a satisfactory solution, but both are on the way
toward such a result. The next great effort to strip off the
evils entailed on us by the Civil War will consist in the repeal
of those taxes which one man was enabled to levy on
another, under cover of the taxes which the government
had to lay to carry on the war. I have taken my share in
the discussion of the first two questions, and I expect to
take my share in the discussion of the third.</p>

<p>I have written this book as a contribution to a popular
agitation. I have not troubled myself to keep or to throw
off scientific or professional dignity. I have tried to make
my point as directly and effectively as I could for the
readers whom I address, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, the intelligent voters of all
degrees of general culture, who need to have it explained
to them what protectionism is and how it works. I have
therefore pushed the controversy just as hard as I could,
and have used plain language, just as I have always done
before in what I have written on this subject. I must therefore
forego the hope that I have given any more pleasure
now than formerly to the advocates of protectionism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>Protectionism seems to me to deserve only contempt and
scorn, satire and ridicule. It is such an arrant piece of
economic quackery, and it masquerades under such an affectation
of learning and philosophy, that it ought to be
treated as other quackeries are treated. Still, out of deference
to its strength in the traditions and lack of information
of many people, I have here undertaken a patient and
serious exposition of it. Satire and derision remain reserved
for the dogmatic protectionists and the sentimental
protectionists; the Philistine protectionists and those who
hold the key of all knowledge; the protectionists of stupid
good faith and those who know their dogma is a humbug
and are therefore irritated at the exposure of it; the protectionists
by birth and those by adoption; the protectionists
for hire and those by election; the protectionists
by party platform and those by pet newspaper; the protectionists
by “invincible ignorance” and those by vows
and ordination; the protectionists who run colleges and
those who want to burn colleges down; the protectionists
by investment and those who sin against light; the hopeless
ones who really believe in British gold and dread the
Cobden Club, and the dishonest ones who storm about
those things without believing in them; those who may not
be answered when they come into debate, because they are
“great” men, or because they are “old” men, or because
they have stock in certain newspapers, or are trustees of
certain colleges. All these have honored me personally, in
this controversy, with more or less of their particular attention.
I confess that it has cost me something to leave
their cases out of account, but to deal with them would
have been a work of entertainment, not of utility.</p>

<p>Protectionism arouses my moral indignation. It is a
subtle, cruel, and unjust invasion of one man’s rights by
another. It is done by force of law. It is at the same
time a social abuse, an economic blunder, and a political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
evil. The moral indignation which it causes is the motive
which draws me away from the scientific pursuits which
form my real occupation, and forces me to take part in a
popular agitation. The doctrine of a “call” applies in
such a case, and every man is bound to take just so great a
share as falls in his way. That is why I have given more
time than I could afford to popular lectures on this subject,
and it is why I have now put the substance of those lectures
into this book.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter I</span><br />

<span class="subhead">DEFINITIONS: STATEMENT OF THE QUESTION
TO BE INVESTIGATED</span></h3>

<h4>(<i>A</i>) <span class="smcap">The System of which Protection is a Survival.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_1">1. The statesmen of the eighteenth century supposed
that their business was the art of national prosperity.
Their procedure was to form ideals of political greatness
and civil prosperity on the one hand, and to evolve out of
their own consciousness grand dogmas of human happiness
and social welfare on the other hand. Then they tried to
devise specific means for connecting these two notions with
each other. Their ideals of political greatness contained,
as predominant elements, a brilliant court, a refined and
elegant aristocracy, well-developed fine arts and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">belles
lettres</i>, a powerful army and navy, and a peaceful, obedient,
and hard-working peasantry and artisan class to pay the
taxes and support the other part of the political structure.
In this ideal the lower ranks paid upward, and the upper
ranks blessed downward, and all were happy together.
The great political and social dogmas of the period were
exotic and incongruous. They were borrowed or accepted
from the classical authorities. Of course the dogmas were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
chiefly held and taught by the philosophers, but, as the
century ran its course, they penetrated the statesman class.
The statesman who had had no purpose save to serve the
“grandeur” of the king, or to perpetuate a dynasty, gave
way to statesmen who had strong national feeling and
national ideals, and who eagerly sought means to realize
their ideals. Having as yet no definite notion, based on
facts of observation and experience, of what a human
society or a nation is, and no adequate knowledge of the
nature and operation of social forces, they were driven to
empirical processes which they could not test, or measure,
or verify. They piled device upon device and failure upon
failure. When one device failed of its intended purpose
and produced an unforeseen evil, they invented a new device
to prevent the new evil. The new device again failed
to prevent, and became a cause of a new harm, and so on
indefinitely.</p>

<p id="sec_2">2. Among their devices for industrial prosperity were
(1) export taxes on raw materials, to make raw materials
abundant and cheap at home; (2) bounties on the export
of finished products, to make the exports large; (3) taxes
on imported commodities to make the imports small, and
thus, with No. 2, to make the “balance of trade” favorable,
and to secure an importation of specie; (4) taxes or prohibition
on the export of machinery, so as not to let foreigners
have the advantage of domestic inventions; (5) prohibition
on the emigration of skilled laborers, lest they should carry
to foreign rivals knowledge of domestic arts; (6) monopolies
to encourage enterprise; (7) navigation laws to foster
ship-building or the carrying trade, and to provide sailors
for the navy; (8) a colonial system to bring about by political
force the very trade which the other devices had
destroyed by economic interference; (9) laws for fixing
wages and prices to repress the struggle of the non-capitalist
class to save themselves in the social press; (10) poor-laws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
to lessen the struggle by another outlet; (11) extravagant
criminal laws to try to suppress another development of
this struggle by terror; and so on, and so on.</p>

<h4>(<i>B</i>) <span class="smcap">Old and New Conceptions of the State.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_3">3. Here we have a complete illustration of one mode of
looking at human society, or at a state. Such society is,
on this view, an artificial or mechanical product. It is an
object to be molded, made, produced by contrivance.
Like every product which is brought out by working up to
an ideal instead of working out from antecedent truth and
fact, the product here is haphazard, grotesque, false. Like
every other product which is brought out by working on
lines fixed by <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> assumptions, it is a satire on human
foresight and on what we call common sense. Such a
state is like a house of cards, built up anxiously one upon
another, ready to fall at a breath, to be credited at most
with naïve hope and silly confidence; or, it is like the long
and tedious contrivance of a mischievous schoolboy, for
an end which has been entirely misappreciated and was
thought desirable when it should have been thought a
folly; or, it is like the museum of an alchemist, filled with
specimens of his failures, monuments of mistaken industry
and testimony of an erroneous method; or, it is like the
clumsy product of an untrained inventor, who, instead of
asking: “what means have I, and to what will they serve?”
asks: “what do I wish that I could accomplish?” and
seeks to win steps by putting in more levers and cogs, increasing
friction and putting the solution ever farther off.</p>

<p id="sec_4">4. Of course such a notion of a state is at war with the
conception of a state as a seat of original forces which
must be reckoned with all the time; as an organism whose
life will go on anyhow, perverted, distorted, diseased,
vitiated as it may be by obstructions or coercions; as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
seat of life in which nothing is ever lost, but every antecedent
combines with every other and has its share in the
immediate resultant, and again in the next resultant, and
so on indefinitely; as the domain of activities so great that
they should appall any one who dares to interfere with
them; of instincts so delicate and self-preservative that it
should be only infinite delight to the wisest man to see
them come into play, and his sufficient glory to give them
a little intelligent assistance. If a state well performed its
functions of providing peace, order, and security, as <em>conditions</em>
under which the people could live and work, it
would be the proudest proof of its triumphant success that
it had nothing to do—that all went so smoothly that it
had only to look on and was never called to interfere; just
as it is the test of a good business man that his business
runs on smoothly and prosperously while he is not harassed
or hurried. The people who think that it is proof of enterprise
to meddle and “fuss” may believe that a good
state will constantly interfere and regulate, and they may
regard the other type of state as “non-government.” The
state can do a great deal more than to discharge police
functions. If it will <em>follow</em> custom, and the growth of social
structure to provide for new social needs, it can powerfully
aid the production of structure by laying down lines of
common action, where nothing is needed but <em>some</em> common
action on conventional lines; or, it can systematize a number
of arrangements which are not at their maximum utility
for want of concord; or, it can give sanction to new rights
which are constantly created by new relations under new
social organizations, and so on.</p>

<p id="sec_5">5. The latter idea of the state has only begun to win
way. All history and sociology bear witness to its comparative
truth, at least when compared with the former.
Under the new conception of the state, of course liberty
means breaking off the fetters and trammels which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
“wisdom” of the past has forged, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez-faire</i>, or “let
alone,” becomes a cardinal maxim of statesmanship, because
it means: “Cease the empirical process. Institute
the scientific process. Let the state come back to normal
health and activity, so that you can study it, learn something
about it from an observation of its phenomena, and
then regulate your action in regard to it by intelligent
knowledge.” Statesmen suited to this latter type of state
have not yet come forward in any great number. The new
radical statesmen show no disposition to let their neighbors
alone. They think that they have come into power just
because they know what their neighbors need to have done
to them. Statesmen of the old type, who told people that
they knew how to make everybody happy, and that they
were going to do it, were always far better paid than any
of the new type ever will be, and their failures never cost
them public confidence either. We have got tired of kings,
priests, nobles and soldiers, not because they failed to
make us all happy, but because our <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> dogmas have
changed fashion. We have put the administration of the
state in the hands of lawyers, editors, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">littérateurs</i>, and professional
politicians, and they are by no means disposed to
abdicate the functions of their predecessors, or to abandon
the practice of the art of national prosperity. The chief
difference is that, whereas the old statesmen used to temper
the practice of their art with care for the interests of the
kings and aristocracies which put them in power, the new
statesmen feel bound to serve those sections of the population
which have put them where they are.</p>

<p id="sec_6">6. Some of the old devices above enumerated (§ <a href="#sec_2">2</a>) are,
however, out of date, or are becoming obsolete.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
3, taxes on imports for other than fiscal purposes, is not
among this number. Just now such taxes seem to be coming
back into fashion, or to be enjoying a certain revival.
It is a sign of the deficiency of our sociology as compared
with our other sciences that such a phenomenon could be
presented in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, as
a certain revival of faith in the efficiency of taxes on imports
as a device for producing national prosperity. There
is not a single one of the eleven devices mentioned above,
including taxes on the exportation of machinery and prohibitions
on emigration, which is not quite as rational and
sound as taxes on imports.</p>

<p>I now propose to analyze and criticize protectionism.</p>

<h4>(<i>C</i>) <span class="smcap">Definition of Protectionism—Definition of
“Theory.”</span></h4>

<p id="sec_7">7. By protection<em>ism</em> I mean the doctrine of protective
taxes as a device to be employed in the art of national
prosperity. The protectionists are fond of representing
themselves as “practical” and the free traders as “theorists.”
“Theory” is indeed one of the most abused words
in the language, and the scientists are partly to blame for
it. They have allowed the word to come into use, even
among themselves, for <em>a conjectural explanation</em>, or <em>a speculative
conjecture</em>, or <em>a working hypothesis</em>, or <em>a project which
has not yet been tested by experiment</em>, or <em>a plausible and harmless
theorem about transcendental relations</em>, or <em>about the way
in which men will act under certain motives</em>. The newspapers
seem often to use the word “theoretical” as if they
meant by it imaginary or fictitious. I use the word “theory,”
however, not in distinction from fact, but, in what I
understand to be the correct scientific use of the word, to
denote <em>a rational description of a group of coördinated facts
in their sequence and relations</em>. A theory may, for a special
purpose, describe only certain features of facts and disregard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
others. Hence “in practice,” where facts present
themselves in all their complexity, he who has carelessly
neglected the limits of his theory may be astonished at
phenomena which present themselves; but his astonishment
will be due to a blunder on his part, and will not be
an imputation on the theory.</p>

<p id="sec_8">8. Now free trade is not a theory in any sense of the
word. <em>It is only a mode of liberty</em>; one form of the assault
(and therefore negative) which the expanding intelligence
of the present is making on the trammels which it has inherited
from the past. Inside the United States, absolute
free trade exists over a continent. No one thinks of it or
realizes it. No one “feels” it. We feel only constraint
and oppression. If we get liberty we reflect on it only so
long as the memory of constraint endures. I have again
and again seen the astonishment with which people realized
the fact when presented to them that they have been living
under free trade all their lives and never thought of it.
When the whole world shall obtain and enjoy free trade
there will be nothing more to be said about it; it will disappear
from discussion and reflection; it will disappear
from the text-books on political economy as the chapters
on slavery are disappearing; it will be as strange for men
to think that they might <em>not</em> have free trade as it would be
now for an American to think that he might not travel in
this country without a passport, or that there ever was a
chance that the soil of our western states might be slave
soil and not free soil. It would be as reasonable to apply
the word “theory” to the protestant reformation, or to
law reform, or to anti-slavery, or to the separation of church
and state, or to popular rights, or to any other campaign in
the great struggle which we call liberty and progress, as to
apply it to free trade. The pro-slavery men formerly did
apply it to abolition, and with excellent reason, if the use
of it which I have criticized ever was correct; for it required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
great power of realizing in imagination the results
of social change, and great power to follow and trust abstract
reasoning, for any man bred under slavery to realize,
in advance of experiment, the social and economic gain to
be won—<em>most of all for the whites</em>—by emancipation.
It now requires great power of “theoretical conception”
for people who have no experience of the separation of
church and state to realize its benefits and justice. Similar
observations would hold true of all similar reforms.
Free trade is a revolt, a conflict, a reform, a reaction and
recuperation of the body politic, just as free conscience,
free worship, free speech, free press, and free soil have been.
It is in no sense a theory.</p>

<p id="sec_9">9. Protectionism is not a theory in the correct sense of
the term, but it comes under some of the popular and incorrect
uses of the word. It is purely dogmatic and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a
priori</i>. It is desired to attain a certain object—wealth
and national prosperity. Protective taxes are proposed as
a means. It must be assumed that there is some connection
between protective taxes and national prosperity,
some relation of cause and effect, some sequence of expended
energy and realized product, between protective
taxes and national wealth. If then by theory we mean a
speculative conjecture as to occult relations which have
not been and cannot be traced in experience, protection
would be a capital example. Another and parallel example
was furnished by astrology, which assumed a causal
relation between the movements of the planets and the
fate of men, and built up quite an art of soothsaying on
this assumption. Another example, paralleling protectionism
in another feature, was alchemy, which, accepting as
unquestionable the notion that we want to transmute lead
into gold if we can, assumed that there was a philosopher’s
stone, and set to work to find it through centuries of repetition
of the method of “trial and failure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p id="sec_10">10. <em>Protectionism, then, is an</em> <span class="allsmcap">ISM</span>; that is, it is a doctrine
or system of doctrine which offers no demonstration, and
rests upon no facts, but appeals to faith on grounds of its
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> reasonableness, or the plausibility with which it
can be set forth. Of course, if a man should say: “I am
in favor of protective taxes because they bring gain to me.
That is all I care to know about them, and I shall get them
retained as long as I can”—there is no trouble in understanding
him, and there is no use in arguing with him. So
far as he is concerned, the only thing to do is to find his
victims and explain the matter to them. The only thing
which can be discussed is the doctrine of national wealth
by protective taxes. This doctrine has the forms of an
economic theory. It vies with the doctrine of labor and
capital as a part of the science of production. Its avowed
purpose is impersonal and disinterested—the same, in
fact, as that of political economy. It is not, like free trade,
a mere negative position against an inherited system, to
which one is led by a study of political economy. It is a
species of political economy, and aims at the throne of the
science itself. If it is true, it is not a corollary, but a postulate,
on which, and by which, all political economy must
be constructed.</p>

<p id="sec_11">11. But then, lo! if the dogma which constitutes protectionism—<em>national
wealth can be produced by protective
taxes and cannot be produced without them</em>—is enunciated,
instead of going on to a science of political economy based
upon it, the science falls dead on the spot. What can be
said about production, population, land, money, exchange,
labor and all the rest? What can the economist learn or
do? What function is there for the university or school?
There is nothing to do but to go over to the art of legislation,
and get the legislator to put on the taxes. The only
questions which can arise are as to the number, variety,
size, and proportion of the taxes. As to these questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the economist can offer no light. He has no method of investigating
them. He can deduce no principles, lay down
no laws in regard to them. The legislator must go on in
the dark and experiment. If his taxes do not produce the
required result, if there turn out to be “snakes” in the tariff
which he has adopted, he has to change it. If the result
still fails, change it again. Protectionism bars the science
of political economy with a dogma, and the only process of
the art of statesmanship to which it leads is eternal trial
and failure—the process of the alchemist and of the inventor
of perpetual motion.</p>

<h4>(<i>D</i>) <span class="smcap">Definition of Free Trade and of a Protective
Duty.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_12">12. What then is a protective tax? In order to join
issue as directly as possible, I will quote the definitions given
by a leading protectionist journal,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> of both free trade and
protection. “The term ‘free trade,’ although much discussed,
is seldom rightly defined. It does not mean the
abolition of custom houses. Nor does it mean the substitution
of direct for indirect taxation, as a few American
disciples of the school have supposed. It means such an
adjustment of taxes on imports as will cause no diversion
of capital, from any channel into which it would otherwise
flow, into any channel opened or favored by the legislation
which enacts the customs. A country may collect its entire
revenue by duties on imports, and yet be an entirely
free trade country, so long as it does not lay those duties
in such a way as to lead any one to undertake any employment,
or make any investment he would avoid in the
absence of such duties: thus, the customs duties levied by
England—with a very few exceptions—are not inconsistent
with her profession of being a country which believes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
in free trade. They either are duties on articles not
produced in England, or they are exactly equivalent to
the excise duties levied on the same articles if made at
home. They do not lead any one to put his money into
the home production of an article, because they do not
discriminate in favor of the home producer.”</p>

<p id="sec_13">13. “A protective duty, on the other hand, has for its
object to effect the diversion of a part of the capital and
labor of the people out of the channels in which it would
run otherwise, into channels favored or created by law.”</p>

<p>I know of no definitions of these two things which have
ever been made by anybody which are more correct than
these. I accept them and join issue on them.</p>

<h4>(<i>E</i>) <span class="smcap">Protectionism Raises a Purely Domestic
Controversy.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_14">14. It will be noticed that this definition of a protective
duty says nothing about foreigners or about imports. According
to this definition, a protective duty is a device for
effecting a transformation in our own industry. If a tax
is levied at the port of entry on a foreign commodity which
is actually imported, the tax is paid to the treasury and
produces revenue. A protective tax is one which is laid
to act as a bar to importation, in order to keep a foreign
commodity out. It does not act protectively unless it
does act as a bar, and is not a tax on imports but an obstruction
to imports. Hence a protective duty is a wall to
inclose the domestic producer and consumer, and to prevent
the latter from having access to any other source of
supply for his needs, in exchange for his products, than
that one which the domestic producer controls. The purpose
and plan of the device is to enable the domestic producer
to levy on the domestic consumer the taxes which
the government has set up as a barrier, but has not collected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
at the port of entry. Under this device the government
says: “I do not want the revenue, but I will lay the
tax so that you, the selected and favored producer, may
collect it.” “I do not need to tax the consumer for myself,
but I will hold him for you while you tax him.”</p>

<h4>(<i>F</i>) “<span class="smcap">A Protective Duty is not a Tax.</span>”</h4>

<p id="sec_15">15. There are some who say that “a tariff is not a tax,”
or as one of them said before a Congressional Committee:
“We do not like to call it so!” That certainly is the most
humorous of all the funny things in the tariff controversy.
If a tariff is not a tax, what is it? In what category does
it belong? No protectionist has ever yet told. They seem
to think of it as a thing by itself, a Power, a Force, a
sort of Mumbo Jumbo whose special function it is to produce
national prosperity. They do not appear to have analyzed
it, or given themselves an account of it, sufficiently
to know what kind of a thing it is or how it acts. Any
one who says that it is not a tax must suppose that it costs
nothing, that it produces an effect without an expenditure
of energy. They do seem to think that if Congress will
say: “Let a tax of —— per cent be laid on article A,” and
if none is imported, and therefore no tax is paid at the
custom house, national industry will be benefited and
wealth secured, and that there will be no cost or outgo.
If that is so, then the tariff is magic. We have found the
philosopher’s stone. Our congressmen wave a magic wand
over the country and say: “Not otherwise provided for,
one hundred and fifty per cent,” and, presto! there we have
wealth. Again they say: “Fifty cents a yard and fifty
per cent <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad valorem</i>”; and there we have prosperity! If
we should build a wall along the coast to keep foreigners
and their goods out, it would cost something. If we maintained
a navy to blockade our own coast for the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
purpose, it would cost something. Yet it is imagined that
if we do the same by a tax it costs nothing.</p>

<p id="sec_16">16. This is the fundamental fallacy of protection to
which the analysis will bring us back again and again.
Scientifically stated, it is that <em>protectionism sins against the
conservation of energy</em>. More simply stated, it is that <em>the
protectionist either never sees or does not tell the other side of
the account, the cost, the outlay for the gains which he alleges
from protection, and that when these are examined and weighed
they are sure vastly to exceed the gains, if the gains were real</em>,
even taking no account of the harm to national growth
which is done by restriction and interference.</p>

<p id="sec_17">17. There are only three ways in which a man can part
with his product, and different kinds of taxes fall under
different modes of alienating one’s goods. First, he may
exchange his product for the product of others. Then he
parts with his property voluntarily, and for an equivalent.
Taxes which are paid for peace, order, and security, fall
under this head. Secondly, he may give his product
away. Then he parts with it voluntarily without an equivalent.
Taxes which are voluntarily paid for schools, libraries,
parks, etc., fall under this head. Thirdly, he may be
robbed of it. Then he parts with it involuntarily and without
an equivalent. Taxes which are protective fall under
this head. The analysis is exhaustive, and there is no
other place for them. Protective taxes are those which a
man pays to his neighbor to hire him (the neighbor) to
carry on his own business. The first man gets no equivalent
(§ <a href="#sec_108">108</a>). Hence any one who says that a tariff is not
a tax would have to put it in some such category as tribute,
plunder, or robbery. In order, then, that we may not give
any occasion for even an unjust charge of using hard words,
let us go back and call it a tax.</p>

<p id="sec_18">18. In any case it is plain that <em>we have before us the case
of two Americans</em>. The protectionists who try to discuss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the subject always go off to talk English politics and history,
or Ireland, or India, or Turkey. I shall not follow them.
I shall discuss the case between two Americans, which is
the only case there is. Whether Englishmen like our tariff
or not is of no consequence. As a matter of fact, Englishmen
seem to have come to the opinion that if Americans
will take their own home market as their share, and will
keep out of the world’s market, they (the Englishmen) will
agree to the arrangement; but it is immaterial whether
they agree, or are angry. The only question for us is:
What kind of an arrangement is it for one American to
tax another American? How does it work? Who gains
by it? How does it affect our national prosperity?
These and these only are the questions which I intend
to discuss.</p>

<p id="sec_19">19. I shall adopt <em>two different lines of investigation</em>.
First, I shall examine protectionism on its own claims and
pretensions, taking its doctrines and claims for true, and
following them out to see whether they will produce the
promised results; and secondly, I shall attack protectionism
adversely, and controversially. If any one proposes a
device for the public good, he is entitled to candid and patient
attention, but he is also under obligation to show how
he expects his scheme to work, what forces it will bring into
play, how it will use them, etc. The joint stock principle,
credit institutions, coöperation, and all similar devices
must be analyzed and the explanation of their advantage,
if they offer any, must be sought in the principles
which they embody, the forces they employ, the suitableness
of their apparatus. We ought not to put faith in any
device (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>, bi-metalism, socialism) unless the proposers
offer an explanation of it which will bear rigid and pitiless
examination; for, if it is a sound device, such examination
will only produce more and more thorough conviction of
its merits. I shall therefore first take up protectionism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
just as it is offered, and test it, as any candid inquirer might
do, to see whether, as it is presented by its advocates, it
has any claims to confidence.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter II</span><br />

<span class="subhead">PROTECTIONISM EXAMINED ON ITS OWN GROUNDS</span></h3>

<p id="sec_20">20. It is the peculiar irony in all empirical devices in
social science that they not only fail of the effect expected
of them, but that they produce the exact opposite. Paper
money is expected to help the non-capitalist and the debtor
and to make business brisk. It ruins the non-capitalists
and the debtors, and reduces industry and commerce to a
standstill. Socialistic devices are expected to bring about
equality and universal happiness. They produce despotism,
favoritism, inequality, and universal misery. The devices
are, in their operation, true to themselves. They act
just as an unprejudiced examination of them should have
led any one to expect that they would act, or just as a
limited experience has shown that they must act. If protectionism
is only another case of the same kind, an examination
of it on its own grounds must bring out the fact
that it will issue in crippling industry, diminishing capital,
and lowering the average of comfort. Let us see.</p>

<h4>(<i>A</i>) <span class="smcap">Assumptions in Protectionism.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_21">21. Obviously the doctrine includes two assumptions.
The first is, that if we are left to ourselves, each to choose,
under liberty, his line of industrial effort, and to use his
labor and capital, under the circumstances of the country,
as best he can, we shall fail of our highest prosperity.
Secondly, that, if Congress will only tax us (properly) we
can be led up to higher prosperity. Hence it is at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
evident that free trade and protection here are not on a
level. No free trader will affirm that he has a device for
making the country rich, or saving it from hard times, any
more than a respectable physician will tell us that he can
give us specifics and preventives to keep us well. On the
contrary, so long as men live they will do foolish things,
and they will have to bear the penalty; but if they are free,
they will commit only the follies which are their own, and
they will bear the penalties only of those. The protectionist
begins with the premise that we shall make mistakes,
and that is why he, who knows how to make us go right,
proposes to take us in hand. He is like the doctor who can
give us just the pill we need to “cleanse our blood” and
“ward off chills.” <em>Hence either prosperity in a free-trade
country, or distress in a protectionist country, is fatal to protectionism</em>,
while distress in a free-trade country, or prosperity
in a protectionist country proves nothing against
free trade. Hence the fallacy of all Mr. R. P. Porter’s
letters is obvious. (§§ <a href="#sec_52">52</a>, <a href="#sec_92">92</a>, <a href="#sec_102">102</a>, <a href="#sec_154">154</a>.)</p>

<p id="sec_22">22. The device by which we are to be made better than
ourselves is to select some of ourselves, who certainly are
not the best business men among ourselves, to go to Washington,
and there turn around and tax ourselves blindly,
or, if not blindly, craftily and selfishly. Surely this would
be the triumph of stupidity and ignorance over intelligent
knowledge, enterprise and energy. The motive which
would control each of us, if we were free, would be the hope
of the greatest gain. We should have to put industry,
prudence, economy, and enterprise into our business. If
we failed, it would be through error. How is the congressional
interference to act? How is it to meet and correct
our error? It can appeal to no other motive than desire
for profit, and can only offer us a profit where there was
none before, if we will turn out of the industry which we
have selected, into one which we do not know. It offers a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
greater profit there only by means of what it takes from
somebody else and somewhere else. Or, is congressional
interference to correct the errors of John, James and
William, and to make the idle, industrious, and the extravagant
prudent? Any one who believes it must believe
that the welfare of mankind is not dependent on the reason
and conscience of the interested persons themselves, but on
the caprices of blundering ignorance, embodied in a selected
few, or on the trickery of lobbyists, acting impersonally and
at a distance.</p>

<h4>(<i>B</i>) <span class="smcap">Necessary Conditions of Successful Protective
Legislation.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_23">23. Suppose, however, that it were true that Congress
had the power (by some exercise of the taxing function) to
influence favorably the industrial development of the
country: is it not true that men of sense would demand to
be satisfied on three points, as follows?</p>

<p id="sec_24">24. (<i>a</i>) If Congress can do this thing, and is going to try
it, <em>ought it not, in order to succeed, to have a distinct idea of
what it is aiming at and proposes to do</em>? Who would have
confidence in any man who should set out on an enterprise
and who did not satisfy this condition? Has Congress
ever satisfied it? Never. They have never had any plan
or purpose in their tariff legislation. Congress has simply
laid itself open to be acted upon by the interested parties,
and the product of its tariff legislation has been simply the
resultant of the struggles of the interested cliques with
each other, and of the log-rolling combinations which they
have been forced to make among themselves. In 1882
Congress did pay some deference, real or pretended, to the
plain fact that it was bound, if it exercised this mighty
power and responsibility, to bring some intelligence to
bear on it, and it appointed a Tariff Commission which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
spent several months in collecting evidence. This Commission
was composed, with one exception, of protectionists.
It recommended a reduction of twenty-five per cent in the
tariff, and said: “Early in its deliberations the Commission
became convinced that a substantial reduction of tariff duties
is demanded, not by a mere indiscriminate popular clamor,
but by the best conservative opinion of the country.”
“Excessive duties are positively injurious to the interests
which they are supposed to benefit. They encourage the
investment of capital in manufacturing enterprises by rash
and unskilled speculators, to be followed by disaster to the
adventurers and their employees, and a plethora of commodities
which deranges the operations of skilled and
prudent enterprise.” (§ <a href="#sec_111">111</a>.) This report was entirely
thrown aside, and Congress, ignoring it entirely, began
again in exactly the old way. The Act of 1883 was not
even framed by or in Congress. It was carried out into
the dark, into a conference committee,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> where new and
gross abuses were put into the bill under cover of a pretended
revision and reduction. When a tariff bill is before
Congress, the first draft starts with a certain rate on a
certain article, say twenty per cent. It is raised by amendment
to fifty, the article is taken into a combination and
the rate put up to eighty per cent; the bill is sent to the
other house, and the rate on this article cut down again to
forty per cent; on conference between the two houses the
rate is fixed at sixty per cent. He who believes in the protectionist
doctrine must, if he looks on at that proceeding,
believe that the prosperity of the country is being kicked
around the floor of Congress, at the mercy of the chances
which are at last to determine with what per cent of tax
these articles will come out. And what is it that determines
with what tax any given article will come out? Any intelligent
knowledge of industry? Not a word of it. Nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
in the case of a given tax on a given article, but just this:
“Who is behind it?” The history of tariff legislation by
the Congress of the United States throws a light upon the
protective doctrine which is partly grotesque and partly
revolting.</p>

<p id="sec_25">25. (<i>b</i>) If Congress can exert the supposed beneficent influence
on industry, <em>ought not Congress to understand the
force which it proposes to use</em>? Ought it not to have some
rules of protective legislation so as to know in what cases,
within what limits, under what conditions, the device can
be effectively used? Would that not be a reasonable demand
to make of any man who should propose a device for
any purpose? Congress has never had any knowledge of
the way in which the taxes which it passed were to do this
beneficent work. It has never had, and has never seemed
to think that it needed to get, any knowledge of the mode
of operation of protective taxes. It passes taxes, as big as
the conflicting interests will allow, and goes home, satisfied
that it has saved the country. What a pity that philosophers,
economists, sages, and moralists should have spent
so much time in elucidating the conditions and laws of
human prosperity! Taxes can do it all.</p>

<p id="sec_26">26. (<i>c</i>) If Congress can do what is affirmed and is going
to try it, is it not the part of common sense to demand that
<em>some tests be applied to the experiment after a few years to see
whether it is really doing as was expected</em>? In the campaign
of 1880 it was said that if Hancock was elected we should
have free trade, wages would fall, factories would be closed,
etc. Hancock was not elected, we did not get any reform
of the tariff, and yet in 1884 wages were falling, factories
were closed, and all the other direful consequences which
were threatened had come to pass. <cite>Bradstreet’s</cite> made investigations
in the winter of 1884–1885 which showed that
316,000 workmen, thirteen per cent of the number employed
in manufacturing in 1880, were out of work, 17,550 on strike,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
and that wages had fallen since 1882 from ten to forty per
cent, especially in the leading lines of manufacturing which
are protected. What did these calamities all prove then?
If we had had any revision of the tariff, should we not have
had these things alleged again and again as results of it?
Did they not, then, in the actual case, prove the folly of
protection? Oh, no! that would be attacking the sacred
dogma, and the sacred dogma is a matter of faith, so that,
as it never had any foundation in fact or evidence, it has
just as much after the experiment has failed as before the
experiment was made.</p>

<p id="sec_27">27. If, now, it were possible to devise a scheme of legislation
which should, according to protectionist ideas, be just
the right jacket of taxation to fit this country to-day, <em>how
long would it fit</em>? Not a week. Here are certain millions
of people on three and a half million square miles of land.
Every day new lines of communication are opened, new
discoveries made, new inventions produced, new processes
applied, and the consequence is that the industrial system
is in constant flux and change. How, if a correct system
of protective taxes was a practicable thing at any given
moment, could Congress keep up with the changes and
readaptations which would be required? The notion is
preposterous, and it is a monstrous thing, even on the protectionist
hypothesis, that we are living under a protective
system which was set up in 1864. The weekly tariff decisions
by the treasury department may be regarded as the
constant attempts that are required to fit that old system
to present circumstances, and, as it is not possible that new
fabrics, new compounds, and new processes should find a
place in schedules which were made twenty years before
they were invented, those decisions carry with them the
fate of scores of new industries which figure in no census,
and are taken into account by no congressman. Therefore,
even if we believed that the protective doctrine was sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
and that some protective system was beneficial, and that
the one which we have was the right one when it was
made, we should be driven to the conclusion that one which
is twenty years old is sure to be injurious to-day.</p>

<p id="sec_28">28. There is nothing then in the legislative machinery
by which the tariff is to be made which is calculated to win
the confidence of a man of sense, but everything to the contrary;
and the experiments of such legislation which have
been made have produced nothing but warnings against
the device. Instead of offering any reasonable ground for
belief that our errors will be corrected and our productive
powers increased, an examination of the tariff as a piece of
legislation offers to us nothing but a burden, which must
cripple any economic power which we have.</p>

<h4>(<i>C</i>) <span class="smcap">Examination of the Means Proposed</span>,
<abbr>viz.</abbr>, <span class="smcap">Taxes</span>.</h4>

<p id="sec_29">29. Every tax is a burden, and in the nature of the case
can be nothing else. In mathematical language, every tax
is a quantity affected by a minus sign. If it gets peace and
security, that is, if it represses crime and injustice and prevents
discord, which would be economically destructive,
then it is a smaller minus quantity than the one which
would otherwise be there, and that is the gain by good
government. Hence, like every other outlay which we
make, taxes must be controlled by the law of economy—to
get the best and most possible for the least expenditure.
Instead of regarding public expenditure carelessly, we
should watch it jealously. Instead of looking at taxation
as conceivably a good, and certainly not an ill, we should
regard every tax as on the defensive, and every cent of tax
as needing justification. If the statesman exacts any
more than is necessary to pay for good government economically
administered, he is incompetent, and fails in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
duty. I have been studying political economy almost exclusively
for the last fifteen years, and when I look back
over that period and ask myself what is the most marked
effect which I can perceive on my own opinion, or on my
standpoint, as to social questions, I find that it is this: I
am convinced that nobody yet understands the multiplied
and complicated effects which are produced by taxation.
I am under the most profound impression of the mischief
which is done by taxation, reaching, as it does, to every
dinner-table and to every fireside. <em>The effects of taxation
vary with every change in the industrial system and the industrial
status</em>, and they are so complicated that it is impossible
to follow, analyze, and systematize them; but out
of the study of the subject there arises this firm conviction:
taxation is crippling, shortening, reducing all the
time, over and over again.</p>

<p id="sec_30">30. Suppose that a man has an income of one thousand
dollars, of which he has been saving one hundred dollars
per annum with no tax. Now a tax of ten dollars is
demanded of him, no matter what kind of a tax or how
laid. Is he to get the tax out of the nine hundred dollars
expenditure or out of the one hundred dollars savings? If
the former, then he must cut down his diet, or his clothing,
or his house accommodation, that is, lower his standard of
comfort. If the latter, then he must lessen his accumulation
of capital, that is, his provision for the future. Either
way his welfare is reduced and cannot be otherwise affected,
and, through the general effect, the welfare of the community
is reduced by the tax. Of course it is immaterial
that he may not know the facts. The effects are the same.
In this view of the matter it is plain what mischief is done
by taxes which are laid to buy parks, libraries, and all sorts
of grand things. The tax-layer is not providing public
order. He is spending other people’s earnings for them.
He is deciding that his neighbor shall have less clothes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
more library or park. But when we come to protective
taxes the abuse is monstrous. The legislator who has
in his hands this power of taxation uses it to say that
one citizen shall have less clothes in order that he may
contribute to the profits of another citizen’s private
business.</p>

<p id="sec_31">31. Hence if we look at the nature of taxation, and if
we are examining protectionism from its own standpoint,
under the assumption that it is true, instead of finding any
confirmation of its assumptions, in the nature of the means
which it proposes to use, we find the contrary. Granting
that people make mistakes and fail of the highest prosperity
which they might win when they act freely, we see
plainly that more taxes cannot help to lift them up or to
correct their errors; on the contrary, <em>all taxation, beyond
what is necessary for an economical administration of good
government, is either luxurious or wasteful</em>, and if such taxation
could tend to wealth, waste would make wealth.</p>

<h4>(<i>D</i>) <span class="smcap">Examination of the Plan of Mutual
Taxation.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_32">32. Suppose then that the industries and sections all begin
to tax each other as we see that they do under protection.
Is it not plain that the taxing operation can do
nothing but <em>transfer</em> products, never by any possibility
create them? The object of the protective taxes is to “effect
the diversion of a part of the capital and labor of the
country from the channels in which it would run otherwise.”
To do this it must find a fulcrum or point of reaction,
or it can exert no force for the effect it desires. The
fulcrum is furnished by those who pay the tax. Take a
case. Pennsylvania taxes New England on every ton of
iron and coal used in its industries. Ohio taxes New
England on all the wool obtained from that state for its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
industries.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> New England taxes Ohio and Pennsylvania on
all the cottons and woolens which it sells to them. What
is the net final result? It is mathematically certain that
the only result can be that (1) New England gets back
just all she paid (in which case the system is nil, save for
the expense of the process and the limitation it imposes on
the industry of all), or, (2) that New England does not get
back as much as she paid (in which case she is tributary to
the others), or, (3) that she gets back more than she paid
(in which case she levies tribute on them). Yet, on the
protectionist notion, this system extended to all sections,
and embracing all industries, is the means of producing
national prosperity. When it is all done, what does it
amount to except that <em>all Americans must support all
Americans</em>? How can they do it better than for each to
support himself to the best of his ability? Then, however,
all the assumptions of protectionism must be abandoned
as false.</p>

<p id="sec_33">33. In 1676 King Charles II granted to his natural son,
the Duke of Richmond, a tax of a shilling a chaldron on
all the coal which was exported from the Tyne. We regard
such a grant as a shocking abuse of the taxing power.
It is, however, a very interesting case because the mine
owner and the tax owner were two separate persons, and
the tax can be examined in all its separate iniquity. If,
as I suppose was the case, the Tyne Valley possessed such
superior facilities for producing coal that it had a qualified
monopoly, the tax fell on the coal mine owner (landlord);
that is, the king transferred to his son part of the property
which belonged to the Tyne coal owners. In that view the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
case may come home to some of our protectionists as it
would not if the tax had fallen on the consumers. If Congress
had pensioned General Grant by giving him seventy-five
cents a ton on all the coal mined in the Lehigh Valley,
what protests we should have heard from the owners of
coal lands in that district! If the king’s son, however, had
owned the coal mines, and worked them himself, and if the
king had said: “I will authorize you to raise the price of
your coal a shilling a chaldron, and, to enable you to do it,
I will myself tax all coal but yours a shilling a chaldron,”
then the device would have been modern and enlightened
and American. We have done just that on emery, copper,
and nickel. Then the tax comes out of the consumer.
Then it is not, according to the protectionist, harmful, but
the key to national prosperity, the thing which corrects
the errors of our incompetent self-will, and leads us up
to better organization of our industry than we, in our
unguided stupidity, could have made.</p>

<h4>(<i>E</i>) <span class="smcap">Examination of the Proposal to “Create an
Industry.”</span></h4>

<p id="sec_34">34. The protectionist says, however, that he is going to
create an industry. Let us examine this notion also from
his standpoint, assuming the truth of his doctrine, and see
if we can find anything to deserve confidence. A protective
tax, according to the protectionist’s definition (§ <a href="#sec_13">13</a>),
“has for its object to effect the diversion of a part of the
labor and capital of the people ... into channels favored or
created by law.” If we follow out this proposal, we shall
see what those channels are, and shall see whether they
are such as to make us believe that protective taxes can
increase wealth.</p>

<p id="sec_35">35. <em>What is an industry?</em> Some people will answer: It
is an enterprise which gives employment. Protectionists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
seem to hold this view, and they claim that they “give
work” to laborers when they make an industry. On that
notion we live to work; we do not work to live. But we
do not want work. We have too much work. We want
a living; and work is the inevitable but disagreeable price
we must pay. Hence we want as much living at as little
price as possible. We shall see that the protectionist does
“make work” in the sense of lessening the living and increasing
the price. But if we want a living we want capital.
If an industry is to pay wages, it must be backed up by
capital. Therefore protective taxes, if they were to increase
the means of living, would need to increase capital.
How can taxes increase capital? Protective taxes only
take from A to give to B. Therefore, if B by this arrangement
can extend his industry and “give more employment,”
A’s power to do the same is diminished in at least an equal
degree. Therefore, even on that erroneous definition of
an industry, there is no hope for the protectionist.</p>

<p id="sec_36">36. <em>An industry is an organization of labor and capital
for satisfying some need of the community.</em> It is not an end
in itself. It is not a good thing to have in itself. It is
not a toy or an ornament. If we could satisfy our needs
without it we should be better off, not worse off. How,
then, can we create industries?</p>

<p id="sec_37">37. If any one will find, in the soil of a district, some
new power to supply human needs, he can endow that
district with a new industry. If he will invent a mode of
treating some natural deposit, ore or clay, for instance, so
as to provide a tool or utensil which is cheaper and more
convenient than what is in use, he can create an industry.
If he will find out some new and better way to raise cattle
or vegetables, which is, perhaps, favored by the climate,
he can do the same. If he invents some new treatment of
wool, or cotton, or silk, or leather, or makes a new combination
which produces a more convenient or attractive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
fabric, he may do the same. The telephone is a new industry.
What measures the gain of it? Is it the “employment”
of certain persons in and about telephone
offices? The gain is in the satisfaction of the need of communication
between people at less cost of time and labor.
It is useless to multiply instances. It can be seen what
it is to “create an industry.” It takes brains and energy
to do it. How can taxes do it?</p>

<p id="sec_38">38. Suppose that we create an industry even in this
sense—<em>What is the gain of it?</em> The people of Connecticut
are now earning their living by employing their labor and
capital in certain parts of the industrial organization.
They have changed their “industries” a great many times.
If it should be found that they had a new and better chance
hitherto undeveloped, they might all go into it. To do
that they must abandon what they are now doing. They
would not change unless gains to be made in the new industry
were greater. Hence the gain is the <em>difference</em> only
between the profits of the old and the profits of the new.
The protectionists, however, when they talk about “creating
an industry,” seem to suppose that the total profit of
the industry (and some of them seem to think that the total
expenditure of capital) measures their good work. In any
case, then, even of a true and legitimate increase of industrial
power and opportunity, the only gain would be a
margin. But, by our definition, “a protective duty has
for its object to effect the diversion of a part of the capital
and labor of the people out of the channels in which it would
otherwise run.” Plainly this device involves coercion.
People would need no coercion to go into a new industry
which had a natural origin in new industrial power or opportunity.
No coercion is necessary to make men buy
dollars at ninety-eight cents apiece. The case for coercion
is when it is desired to make them buy dollars at one
hundred and one cents apiece. Here the statesman with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
taxing power is needed, and can do something. What?
He can say: “If you will buy a dollar at one hundred
and one cents, I can and will tax John over there two
cents for your benefit; one to make up your loss and the
other to give you a profit.” Hence, <em>on the protectionist’s
own doctrine</em>, his device is not needed, and cannot come
into use, when a new industry is created in the true and
only reasonable sense of the words, but <em>only when and
because he is determined to drive the labor and capital of
the country into a disadvantageous and wasteful employment</em>.</p>

<p id="sec_39">39. Still further, it is obvious that the protectionist,
instead of “creating a new industry,” has <em>simply taken one
industry and set it as a parasite to live upon another</em>. Industry
is its own reward. A man is not to be paid a premium
by his neighbors for earning his own living. A
factory, an insane asylum, a school, a church, a poorhouse,
and a prison cannot be put in the same economic category.
We know that the community must be taxed to support
insane asylums, poorhouses, and jails. When we come
upon such institutions we see them with regret. They are
wasting capital. We know that the industrious people all
about, who are laboring and producing, must part with a
portion of their earnings to supply the waste and loss of
these institutions. Hence <em>the bigger they are the sadder they
are</em>.</p>

<p id="sec_40">40. As for the schools and churches, we know that
society must pay for and keep up its own conservative institutions.
They cost capital and do not pay back capital
directly, although they do indirectly, and in the course of
time, in ways which we could trace out and verify if that
were our subject. Here, then, we have a second class of
institutions.</p>

<p id="sec_41">41. But the factories and farms and foundries are the
productive institutions which must provide the support of
these consuming institutions. If the factories, etc., put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
themselves on a line with the poorhouses, or even with the
schools, what is to support them and all the rest too?
They have nothing behind them. If in any measure or
way they turn into burdens and objects of care and protection,
they can plainly do it only by part of them turning
upon the other part, and this latter part will have to
bear the burden of all the consuming institutions, <em>including
the consuming industries</em>. For a protected factory is not a
producing industry. <em>It is a consuming industry!</em> If a
factory is (as the protectionist alleges) a triumph of the
tariff, that is, if it would not be but for the tariff (and otherwise
he has nothing to do with it), then it is not producing;
it is consuming. It is a burden to be borne. <em>The bigger it
is the sadder it is.</em></p>

<p id="sec_42">42. If a protectionist shows me a woolen mill and challenges
me to deny that it is a great and valuable industry,
I ask him whether it is due to the tariff. If he says “no,”
then I will assume that it is an independent and profitable
establishment, but in that case it is out of this discussion as
much as a farm or a doctor’s practice. If he says “yes,”
then I answer that the mill is not an industry at all. We
pay sixty per cent tax on cloth <em>simply in order that that mill
may be</em>. It is not an institution for getting us cloth, for if
we went into the market with the same products which we
take there now and if there were no woolen mill, we should
get all the cloth we want. The mill is simply <em>an institution
for making cloth cost per yard sixty per cent more of
our products than it otherwise would</em>. That is the one and
only function which the mill has added, by its existence,
to the situation. I have called such a factory a “nuisance.”
The word has been objected to. The word is of no consequence.
He who, when he goes into a debate, begins to
whine and cry as soon as the blows get sharp, should learn
to keep out. What I meant was this: A nuisance is something
which by its existence and presence in society works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
loss and damage to the society—works against the general
interest, not for it. A factory which gets in the way
and hinders us from attaining the comforts which we are
all trying to get—which makes harder the terms of acquisition
when we are all the time struggling by our arts
and sciences to make those terms easier—is a harmful
thing, and noxious to the common interest.</p>

<p id="sec_43">43. Hence, once more, starting from the protectionist’s
hypothesis, and assuming his own doctrine, we find that he
cannot create an industry. He only fixes one industry as
a parasite upon another, and just as certainly as he has intervened
in the matter at all, just so certainly has he forced
labor and capital into less favorable employment than they
would have sought if he had let them alone. When we
ask which “channels” those are which are to be “favored
or created by law,” we find that they are, by the hypothesis,
and by the whole logic of the protectionist system, <em>the industries
which do not pay</em>. The protectionists propose to
make the country rich by laws which shall favor or create
these industries, but these industries can only waste capital,
so that if they are the source of wealth, <em>waste is the source
of wealth</em>. Hence the protectionist’s assumption that by
his system he could correct our errors and lead us to greater
prosperity than we would have obtained under liberty, has
failed again, and we find that he wastes what power we do
possess.</p>

<h4>(<i>F</i>) <span class="smcap">Examination of the Proposal to Develop our
Natural Resources.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_44">44. “But,” says the protectionist, “do you mean to say
that, if we have an iron deposit in our soil, it is not wise
for us to open and work it?” “You mean, no doubt,” I
reply, “open and work it <em>under protective help and stimulus</em>;
for, if there is an iron deposit, the United States does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
own it. Some man owns it. If he wants to open and
work it, we have nothing to do but wish him God-speed.”
“Very well,” he says, “understand it that he needs protection.”
Let us examine this case, then, and still we will
do it assuming the truth of the protectionist doctrine.
Let us see where we shall come out.</p>

<p>The man who has discovered iron (on the protectionist
doctrine), when there is no tax, does not collect tools and
laborers and go to work. He goes to Washington. He
visits the statesman, and a dialogue takes place.</p>

<p>Iron man.—“Mr. Statesman, I have found an iron deposit
on my farm.”</p>

<p>Statesman.—“Have you, indeed? That is good news.
Our country is richer by one new natural resource than we
have supposed.”</p>

<p>Iron man.—“Yes, and I now want to begin mining
iron.”</p>

<p>Statesman.—“Very well, go on. We shall be glad to
hear that you are prospering and getting rich.”</p>

<p>Iron man.—“Yes, of course. But I am now earning
my living by tilling the surface of the ground, and I am
afraid that I cannot make as much at mining as at farming.”</p>

<p>Statesman.—“That is indeed another matter. Look
into that carefully and do not leave a better industry for a
worse.”</p>

<p>Iron man.—“But I want to mine that iron. It does
not seem right to leave it in the ground when we are importing
iron all the time, but I cannot see as good profits
in it at the present price for imported iron as I am making
out of what I raise on the surface. I thought that perhaps
you would put a tax on all the imported iron so that
I could get more for mine. Then I could see my way to
give up farming and go to mining.”</p>

<p>Statesman.—“You do not think what you ask. That
would be authorizing you to tax your neighbors, and would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
be throwing on them the risk of working your mine, which
you are afraid to take yourself.”</p>

<p>Iron man (aside).—“I have not talked the right dialect
to this man. I must begin all over again. (Aloud.) Mr.
Statesman, the natural resources of this continent ought to
be developed. American industry must be protected.
The American laborer must not be forced to compete with
the pauper labor of Europe.”</p>

<p>Statesman.—“Now I understand you. Now you talk
business. Why did you not say so before? How much
tax do you want?”</p>

<p>The next time that a buyer of pig iron goes to market
to get some, he finds that it costs thirty bushels of wheat
per ton instead of twenty.</p>

<p>“What has happened to pig iron?” says he.</p>

<p>“Oh! haven’t you heard?” is the reply. “A new mine
has been found down in Pennsylvania. We have got a
new ‘natural resource.’”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got a new ‘natural resource,’” says he. “It
is as bad for me as if the grasshoppers had eaten up one-third
of my crop.”</p>

<p id="sec_45">45. That is just exactly the significance of a new resource
on the protectionist doctrine. We had the misfortune
to find emery here. At once a tax was put on it
which made it cost more wheat, cotton, tobacco, petroleum,
or personal services per pound than ever before. A
new calamity befell us when we found the richest copper
mines in the world in our territory. From that time on it
cost us five (now four) cents a pound more than before.
By another catastrophe we found a nickel mine—thirty
cents (now fifteen) a pound tax! Up to this time we have
had all the tin that we wanted above ground, because
beneficent nature has refrained from putting any underground
in our territory. In the metal schedule, where the
metals which we unfortunately possess are taxed from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
forty to sixty per cent, tin alone is free. Every little while
a report is started that tin has been found. Hitherto these
reports have happily all proved false. It is now said that
tin has been found in West Virginia and Dakotah. We
have reason devoutly to hope that this may prove false,
for, if it should prove true, no doubt the next thing will
be forty per cent tax on tin. The mine-owners say that
they want to exploit the mine. They do not. They want
to make the mine an excuse to exploit the taxpayers.</p>

<p id="sec_46">46. Therefore, when the protectionist asks whether we
ought not by protective taxes to force the development of
our own iron mines, the answer is that, on his own doctrine,
he has developed a new philosophy, hitherto unknown, by
which “natural resources” become national calamities, and
the more a country is endowed by nature the worse off it
is. Of course, if the wise philosophy is not simply to use,
with energy and prudence, all the natural opportunities
which we possess, but to seek “channels favored or created
by law,” then this view of natural resources is perfectly
consistent with that philosophy, for it is simply saying
over again that <em>waste is the key of wealth</em>.</p>

<h4>(<i>G</i>) <span class="smcap">Examination of the Proposal to Raise Wages.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_47">47. “But,” he says again, “we want to raise wages and
favor the poor working man.” “Do you mean to say,”
I reply, “that protective taxes raise wages—that that is
their regular and constant effect?” “Yes,” he replies,
“that is just what they do, and that is why we favor them.
We are the poor man’s friends. You free-traders want to
reduce him to the level of the pauper laborers of Europe.”
“But here, in the evidence offered at the last tariff discussion
in Congress, the employers all said that they wanted
the taxes to protect them <em>because</em> they had to pay such
high wages.” “Well, so they do.” “Well then, if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
get the taxes raised to help them out when they have high
wages to pay, how are the taxes going to help them any
unless the taxes <em>lower</em> wages? But you just said that
taxes raise wages. Therefore, if the employer gets the
taxes raised, he will no sooner get home from Washington
than he will find that the very taxes which he has just
secured have raised wages. Then he must go back to
Washington to get the taxes raised to offset that advance,
and when he gets home again he will find that he has only
raised wages more, and so on forever. You are trying to
teach the man to raise himself by his boot straps. Two
of your propositions brought together eat each other.”</p>

<p id="sec_48">48. We will, however, pursue the protectionist doctrine
of wages a little further. It is totally false that protective
taxes raise wages. As I will show further on (§ <a href="#sec_91">91</a> and
following), protective taxes lower wages. Now, however,
I am assuming the protectionist’s own premises and doctrines
all the time. He says that his system raises wages.
Let us go to see some of the wages class and get some evidence
on this point. We will take three wage-workers, a
boot man, a hat man, and a cloth man. First we ask the
boot man, “Do you win anything by this tariff?” “Yes,”
he says, “I understand that I do.” “How?” “Well, the
way they explain it to me is that when anybody wants
boots he goes to my boss, pays him more on account of
the tax, and my boss gives me part of it.” “All right!
Then your comrades here, the hat man and the cloth man,
pay this tax in which you share?” “Yes, I suppose so.
I never thought of that before. I supposed that rich
people paid the taxes, but I suppose that when they buy
boots they must do it too.” “And when you want a hat
you go and pay the tax on hats, part of which (as you explain
the system) goes to your friend the hat man; and
when you want cloth you pay the tax which goes to benefit
your friend the cloth man?” “I suppose that it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
be so.” We go, then, to see the hat man and have the
same conversation with him, and we go to see the cloth
man and have the same conversation with him. Each of
them then gets two taxes and pays two taxes. Three men
illustrate the whole case. If we should take a thousand
men in a thousand industries we should find that each paid
nine hundred and ninety-nine taxes, and each got nine hundred
and ninety-nine taxes, if the system worked as it is
said to work. What is the upshot of the whole? Either
they all come out even on their taxes paid and received, or
<em>some of the wage receivers are winning something out of other
wage receivers to the net detriment of the whole class</em>. If each
man is creditor for nine hundred and ninety-nine taxes, and
each debtor for nine hundred and ninety-nine taxes, and if
the system is “universal and equal,” we can save trouble
by each drawing nine hundred and ninety-nine orders on
the creditors to pay to themselves their own taxes, and
we can set up a clearing house to wipe off all the accounts.
Then we come down to this as the net result of the system
when it is “universal and equal,” that <em>each man as a consumer
pays taxes to himself as a producer</em>. That is what
is to make us all rich. We can accomplish it just as well
and far more easily, when we get up in the morning, by
transferring our cash from one pocket to the other.</p>

<p id="sec_49">49. One point, however, and the most important of all,
remains to be noticed. How about the thousandth tax?
How is it when the boot man wants boots, and the hat
man hats, and the cloth man cloth? He has to go to the
store on the street and buy of his own boss, at the market
price (tax on), the very things which he made himself in
the shop. He then pays the tax to his own employer, and
the employer, according to the doctrine, “shares” it with
him. Where is the offset to that part which the employer
keeps? There is none. The wages class, even on the protectionist
explanation, may give or take from each other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
but to their own employers they give and take not. At
election time the boss calls them in and tells them that
they must vote for protection or he must shut up the shop,
and that they ought to vote for protection, because it makes
their wages high. If, then, they believe in the system,
just as it is taught to them, they must believe that it causes
him to pay them big wages, out of which they pay back to
him big taxes, out of which he pays them a fraction back
again, and that, but for this arrangement, the business could
not go on at all. A little reflection shows that this just
brings up the question for a wage-earner: <em>How much can I
afford to pay my boss for hiring me?</em> or, again, which is just
the same thing in other words: <em>What is the net reduction of
my wages, below the market rate under freedom, which results
from this system?</em> (See § <a href="#sec_65">65</a>.)</p>

<p id="sec_50">50. Let it not be forgotten that this result is reached by
accepting protectionism and reasoning forward from its
doctrines and according to its principles. In truth, the
employees get no share in any taxes which the boss gets out
of them and others (see § <a href="#sec_91">91</a> ff. for the truth about wages).
Of course, when this or any other subject is thoroughly
analyzed, it makes no difference where we begin or what
line we follow, we shall always reach the same result if the
result is correct. If we accept the protectionist’s own explanation
of the way in which protection raises wages we
find that it proves that protection lowers wages.</p>

<h4>(<i>H</i>) <span class="smcap">Examination of the Proposal to Prevent
Competition by Foreign Pauper Labor.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_51">51. The protectionist says that he does not want the
American laborer to compete with the foreign “pauper
laborer” (see § <a href="#sec_99">99</a>). He assumes, that if the foreign laborer
is a woolen operative, the only American who may have to
compete with him is a woolen operative here. His device<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
for saving our operatives from the assumed competition is
to tax the American cotton or wheat grower on the cloth
he wears, to make up and offset to the woolen operative
the disadvantage under which he labors. If then, the case
were true as the protectionist states it, and if his remedy
were correct, he would, when he had finished his operation,
simply have allowed the American woolen operative to
escape, by transferring to the American cotton or wheat
grower the evil results of competition with “foreign pauper
labor.”</p>

<h4>(<i>I</i>) <span class="smcap">Examination of the Proposal to raise the
Standard of Public Comfort.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_52">52. But the protectionist reiterates that he wants to
make our people well off, and to diffuse general prosperity,
and he says that his system does this. He says that the
country has prospered under protection and on account of
it. He brings from the census the figures for increased
wealth of the country, and, to speak of no minor errors,
draws an inference that we have prospered <em>more than we
should have done under free trade</em>, which is what he has to
prove, without noticing that the second term of the comparison
is absent and unattainable. In the same manner
I once heard a man argue from statistics, who showed by
the <em>small</em> loss of a city by fire that its fire department cost
too much. I asked him if he had any statistics of the fires
which we should have had but for the fire department
(see § <a href="#sec_102">102</a>).</p>

<p id="sec_53">53. The people of the United States have inherited an
untouched continent. The now living generation is practicing
bonanza farming on prairie soil which has never
borne a crop. The population is only fifteen to the square
mile. The population of England and Wales is four hundred
and forty-six to the square mile; that of the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Islands two hundred and ninety; that of Belgium four
hundred and eighty-one; of France one hundred and
eighty; of Germany two hundred and sixteen. Bateman<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
estimates that in the better part of England or Wales a
peasant proprietor would need from four and a half to six
acres, and, in the worse part, from nine to forty-five acres
on which to support “a healthy family.” The soil of
England and Wales, equally divided between the families
there, would give only seven acres apiece. The land of
the United States, equally divided between the families
there, would give two hundred and fifteen acres apiece.
These old nations give us the other term of the comparison
by which we measure our prosperity. They have a dense
population on a soil which has been used for thousands of
years; we have an extremely sparse population on a virgin
soil. We have an excellent climate, mountains full of
coal and ore, natural highways on the rivers and lakes, and
a coast indented with sounds, bays, and some of the best
harbors in the world. We have also a population of good
national character, especially as regards the economic and
industrial virtues. The sciences and arts are highly cultivated
among us, and our institutions are the best for the
development of economic strength. As compared with old
nations we are prosperous. Now comes the protectionist
statesman and says: “The things which you have enumerated
are not the causes of our comparative prosperity.
Those things are all vain. Our prosperity is not due to
them. I made it with my taxes.”</p>

<p id="sec_54">54. (<i>a</i>) In the first place the fact is that we surpass most
in prosperity those nations which are most like us in their
tax systems, and those compared with whom our prosperity
is least remarkable are those which have by free trade offset
as much as possible the disadvantage of age and dense
population. Since, then, we find greatest difference in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
prosperity with least difference in tax, and least difference
in prosperity with greatest difference in tax, we cannot regard
tax as a cause of prosperity, but as an obstacle to prosperity
which must have been overcome by some stronger
cause. That such is the case lies plainly on the face of the
facts. The prosperity which we enjoy is the prosperity
which God and nature have given us <em>minus what the legislator
has taken from it</em>.</p>

<p id="sec_55">55. (<i>b</i>) We prospered with slavery just as we have prospered
with protection. The argument that the former was
a cause would be just as strong as the argument that the
lattes is a cause.</p>

<p id="sec_56">56. (<i>c</i>) The protectionists take to themselves as a credit
all the advance in the arts of the last twenty-five years,
because they have not entirely offset it and destroyed it.</p>

<p id="sec_57">57. (<i>d</i>) The protectionists claim that they have increased
our wealth. All the wealth that is produced must be produced
by labor and capital applied to land. The people
have wrought and produced. The tax gatherer has only
subtracted something. Whether he used what he took well
or ill, he subtracted. He could not do anything else.
Therefore, whatever wealth we see about us, and whatever
wealth appears in the census is what the people have produced,
<em>less</em> what the tax gatherer has taken out of it.</p>

<p id="sec_58">58. (<i>e</i>) If the members of Congress can establish for themselves
some ideal of the grade of comfort which the average
American citizen ought to enjoy, and then just get it for
him, they have used their power hitherto in a very beggarly
manner. For, although the average status of our people is
high when compared with that of other people on the globe,
nevertheless, when compared with any standard of ideal
comfort, it leaves much to be desired. If Congress has
the power supposed, they surely ought not to measure the
exercise of it by only making us better off than Europeans.</p>

<p id="sec_59">59. (<i>f</i>) During the late presidential campaign the protectionist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
orators assured the people that they meant to
make everybody well off, that they wished our people to
be prosperous, contented, etc. I wish so too. I wish that
all my readers may be millionaires. I freely and sincerely
confer on them all the bounty of my good wishes. They
will not find a cent more in their pockets on that account.
The congressmen have no power to bless my readers which
I have not, save one; that is, the power to tax them.</p>

<p id="sec_60">60. (<i>g</i>) If the congressmen are determined to elevate the
comfort of the population by taxing the population, then
every new ship load of immigrants must be regarded as a
new body of persons whom we must “elevate” by the
taxes we have to pay. It is said that an Irishman affirmed
that a dollar in America would not buy more than a shilling
in Ireland. He was asked why then he did not stay in
Ireland. He replied that it was because he could not get
the shilling there. That is a good story, only it stops just
where it ought to begin. The next question is: How does
he get the dollar when he comes to America? The protectionist
wants us to suppose that he gets it by grace of
the tariff. If so he gets it out of those who were here before
he came. But plainly no such thing is true. He gets
it by earning it, and he adds two dollars to the wealth of
the country while earning it. The only thing the tariff
does in regard to it is to lower the purchasing power of the
dollar, if it is spent for products of manufacture, to seventy
cents.</p>

<p id="sec_61">61. Here, again, then, we find that protective taxes, if
they do just what the protectionist says that they will do,
produce the very opposite effects from those which he says
they will produce. They lessen wealth, reduce prosperity,
diminish average comfort, and lower the standard of living.
(See § <a href="#sec_30">30</a>.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter III</span><br />

<span class="subhead">PROTECTIONISM EXAMINED ADVERSELY</span></h3>

<p id="sec_62">62. I have so far examined protectionism as a philosophy
of national wealth, assuming and accepting its own doctrines,
and following them out, to see if they will issue as
is claimed. We have found that they do not, but that protectionism,
on its own doctrines, issues in the impoverishment
of the nation and in failure to do anything which it
claims to do. On the contrary, an examination in detail
of its means, methods, purposes, and plans shows that it
must produce waste and loss, so that <em>if it were true, we
should have to believe that waste and loss are means of wealth</em>.
Now I turn about to attack it in face, on an open issue, for
if any project which is advocated proves, upon free and
fair examination, to be based on errors of fact and doctrine,
it becomes a danger and an evil to be exposed and
combated, and truth of fact and doctrine must be set
against it.</p>

<h4>1. <i>PROTECTIONISM INCLUDES AND NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH
IT HOSTILITY TO TRADE OR, AT LEAST, SUSPICION AGAINST
TRADE</i></h4>

<h5>(<i>A</i>) <span class="smcap">Rules for Knowing when it is Safe to Trade.</span></h5>

<p id="sec_63">63. Every protectionist is forced to regard trade as a
mischievous or at least doubtful thing. Protectionists
have even tried to formulate rules for determining when
trade is beneficial and when harmful.</p>

<p id="sec_64">64. It has been said that we ought to trade only on
meridians of longitude, not on parallels of latitude.</p>

<p id="sec_65">65. It has been affirmed that we cannot safely trade
unless we have taxes to exactly offset the lower wages of
foreign countries. But it is plain that if the case stands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
so that an American employer says: “I am at a disadvantage
compared with my foreign competitor, because he
pays less wages than I”—then, by the same token, the
American laborer will say: “I am at an advantage, compared
with my foreign comrade, for I get better wages
than he.” If the law interferes with the state of things
so that the employer is enabled to say: “I am now at less
disadvantage in competition with my foreign rival, because
I do not now have to pay as much more wages than he
as formerly”—then, by the same token, the American
laborer must say: “I am not now as much better off than
my foreign comrade as formerly, for I do not now gain as
much more than he as I did—there is not now as much
advantage in emigrating to this country as formerly.”
Therefore, whenever the taxes just offset the difference in
wages, <em>they just take away from the American laborer all his
superiority over the foreigner</em>, and take away all reason for
caring to come to this country. So much for the laborer.
But the employer, if he has arrested immigration, has cut
off one source of the supply of labor, tending to raise wages,
and is at war with himself again (§ <a href="#sec_47">47</a>).</p>

<p id="sec_66">66. It has been said that two nations cannot trade <em>if the
rate of interest in the two differs by two per cent</em>. The rate
of interest in the Atlantic States and in the Mississippi
Valley has always differed by two per cent, yet they have
traded together under absolute free trade, and the Mississippi
Valley has had to begin a wilderness and grow up
to the highest standard of civilization in spite of that state
of things.</p>

<p id="sec_67">67. It has been said that we ought to <em>trade only with
inferior nations</em>. The United States does not trade with
any other nation, save when it buys territory. A in the
United States trades with B in some foreign country. If
I want caoutchouc I want to trade with a savage in the
forests of South America. If I want mahogany I want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
trade with a man in Honduras. If I want sugar I want to
trade with a man in Cuba. If I want tea I want to trade
with a man in China. If I want silk or champagne I want
to trade with a man in France. If I want a razor I want to
trade with a man in England. I want to trade with the
man who has the thing which I want of the best quality
and at the lowest rate of exchange for my products. What
is the definition or test of an “inferior nation,” and what
has that got to do with trade any more than the race,
language, color, or religion of the man who has the goods?</p>

<p id="sec_68">68. If trade was an object of suspicion and dread, then
indeed we ought to have <em>rules for distinguishing safe and
beneficial trade</em> from mischievous trade, but these attempts
to define and discriminate only expose the folly of the suspicion.
We find that the primitive men who dwelt in
caves in the glacial epoch carried on trade. The earliest
savages made footpaths through the forests by which to
traffic and trade, winning thereby mutual advantages.
They found that they could supply more wants with less
effort by trade, which gave them a share in the natural
advantages and acquired skill of others. They trained
beasts of burden, improved roads, invented wagons and
boats, all in order to extend and facilitate trade. They
were foolish enough to think that they were gaining by it,
<em>and did not know that they needed a protective tariff to keep
them from ruining themselves</em>. Or, why does not some
protectionist sociologist tell us at what stage of civilization
trade ceases to be advantageous and begins to need
restraint and regulation?</p>

<h5>(<i>B</i>) <span class="smcap">Economic Units not National Units.</span></h5>

<p id="sec_69">69. The protectionists say that their system advances
civilization inside a state and makes it great, but the facts
are all against them (see § <a href="#sec_136">136</a>ff). It was by trade that civilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
was extended over the earth. It was through the
contact of trade that the more civilized nations transmitted
to others the alphabet, weights and measures,
knowledge of astronomy, divisions of time, tools and
weapons, coined money, systems of numeration, treatment
of metals, skins, and wool, and all the other achievements
of knowledge and invention which constitute the
bases of our civilization. On the other hand, the nations
which shut themselves up and developed an independent
and self-contained civilization (China and Japan) present
us the types of arrested civilization and stereotyped social
status. It is the penalty of isolation and of withdrawal
from the giving and taking which properly bind the whole
human race together, that even such intelligent and highly
endowed people as the Chinese should find their high
activity arrested at narrow limitations on every side.
They invent coin, but never get beyond a cast copper coin.
They invent gunpowder, but cannot make a gun. They
invent movable types, but only the most rudimentary
book. They discover the mariner’s compass, but never
pass the infancy of ship-building.</p>

<p id="sec_70">70. The fact is, then, that <em>trade has been the handmaid
of civilization</em>. It has traversed national boundaries, and
has gradually, with improvement in the arts of transportation,
drawn the human race into closer relations and more
harmonious interests. The contact of trade slowly saps
old national prejudice and religious or race hatreds. The
jealousies which were perpetuated by distance and ignorance
cannot stand before contact and knowledge. To stop
trade is to arrest this beneficent work, to separate mankind
into sections and factions, and to favor discord, jealousy,
and war.</p>

<p id="sec_71">71. Such is the action of protectionism. The protectionists
make much of their pretended “nationalism,”
and they try to reason out some kind of relationship between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
the scope of economic forces and the boundaries of
existing nations. The argumentation is fatally broken at
its first step. They do not show what they might show,
<abbr>viz.</abbr>, that the scope of economic forces on any given stage
of the arts does form economic units. An English county
was such a unit a century ago. I doubt if anything less
than the whole earth could be considered so to-day, when
the wool of Australia, the hides of South America, the
cotton of Alabama, the wheat of Manitoba, and the meat
of Texas meet the laborers in Manchester and Sheffield,
and would meet the laborers in Lowell and Paterson, if
the barriers were out of the way. But what the national
protectionist would need to show would be that the economic
unit coincides with the political unit. He would
have to affirm that Maine and Texas are in one economic
unit, but that Maine and New Brunswick are not; or that
Massachusetts and Minnesota are in one economic unit,
but that Massachusetts and Manitoba are not. Every
existing state is a product of historic accidents. Mr.
Jefferson set out to buy the city of New Orleans. He
awoke one morning to find that he had bought the western
half of the Mississippi Valley. Since that turned out so,
the protectionists think that Missouri and Illinois prosper
by trading in perfect freedom.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> If it had not turned out
so, it would have been very mischievous for them to trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
in perfect freedom. Nova Scotia did not join the revolt
of our thirteen colonies. Hence it is thought ruinous to
let coal and potatoes come in freely from Nova Scotia. If
she had revolted with us, it would have been for the benefit
of everybody in this union to trade with her as freely as
we now trade with Maine. We tried to conquer Canada in
1812–1813 and failed. Consequently the Canadians now put
taxes on our coal and petroleum and wheat, and we put
taxes on their lumber, which our coal and petroleum industries
need. We did annex Texas, at the cost of war,
in 1845. Consequently we trade with Texas now under
absolute freedom, but, if we trade with Mexico, it must be
only very carefully and under stringent limitations. Is
this wisdom, or is it all pure folly and wrongheadedness,
by which men who boast of their intelligence throw away
their own chances?<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p id="sec_72">72. <em>Trade is a beneficent thing.</em> It does not need any
regulation or restraint. There is no point at which it
begins to be dangerous. It is mutually beneficent. If it
ceases to be so, it ceases entirely, because he who no longer
gains by it will no longer carry it on. (See § <a href="#sec_125">125</a>.)</p>

<h4>2. <i>PROTECTIONISM IS AT WAR WITH IMPROVEMENT.</i></h4>

<p id="sec_73">73. The cities of Japan are built of very combustible
material, and when a fire begins it is rarely arrested until
the city is destroyed. It was suggested that a steam fire-engine
would there reach its maximum of utility. One
was imported and proved very useful on several occasions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Thereupon the carpenters got up a petition to the government
to send the fire-engine away, because it ruined their
business.</p>

<p id="sec_74">74. The instance is grotesque and exaggerated, but it
is strictly true to the principle of protectionism. The
southern counties of England, a century ago, protested
against the opening of the great northern turnpike, because
that would bring the products of the northern counties to
the London market, of which the southern counties had
had a monopoly. After the St. Gothard tunnel was
opened the people of southern Germany petitioned the
Government to lay higher taxes on Italian products to
offset the cheapness which the tunnel had produced. In
1837 the first two steamers which ever made commercial
voyages across the Atlantic arrived at the same time. A
grand celebration was held in New York. The foolish
people rejoiced as if a new blessing had been won. Man
had won a new triumph over nature. What was the gain
of it? It was that he could satisfy his needs with less
labor than before; or, in plain language, get things cheaper.
But in 1842 a Home Industry Convention was held in New
York, at which it was alleged as the prime reason why more
taxes were needed, that this steam transportation had made
things cheap here.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Taxes were needed to neutralize the
improvement.</p>

<h5>(<i>A</i>) <span class="smcap">Taxes to Offset Cheapened Transportation.</span></h5>

<p id="sec_75">75. For the last twenty-five years, to go no farther
back, we have multiplied inventions to facilitate transportation.
Ocean cables, improved marine engines, and
screw steamers, have been only improved means of supplying
the wants of people on two continents more
abundantly with the products each of the other. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
scientific journals and the daily papers boast of every step
in this development as a thing to be proud of and rejoice
in, but in the meantime the legislators on both sides of the
water are hard at work to neutralize it by taxation. We,
in the United States, have multiplied monstrous taxes on
all the things which others make and which we want, to
prevent them from being brought to us. The statesmen
of the European continent are laying taxes on our meat
and wheat, lest they be brought to their people. The arts
are bringing us together; the taxes are needed to keep us
apart. In France, for instance, the agriculturist complains
of American competition—not “pauper labor,” but gratuitous
soil and sunlight. He does not want the French
artisan to have the benefit of our prairie soil. The government
yields to him and lays a tax on our meat and wheat.
This raises the price of bread in Paris, where the reconstruction
of the city has collected a large artisan population.
The government then finds itself driven to fix the
price of bread in Paris, to keep it down. But the reconstruction
of the city was accomplished by contracting a
great debt, which means heavy taxes. These taxes drive
the population out into the suburbs. At least one voice
has been raised by an owner of city property that a tax
ought to be laid on suburban residents to drive them back
to the city,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> and not let them escape the efforts of the city
landlord to throw his taxes on them. Then, again, France
has been subsidizing ships, and when the question of renewing
the subsidy came up, it was argued that the ships
subsidized at the expense of the French taxpayer had
lowered freight on wheat and made wheat cheap; that is,
as somebody justly replied, had wrought the very mischief
against which the increased tax had just been demanded
on wheat. Therefore the taxpayer had been
taxed first to make wheat cheap, and then again to make
it dear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p id="sec_76">76. Tax A to favor B. If A complains, tax C to make
it up to A. If C complains, tax B to favor C. If any of
them still complain, begin all over again. Tax them as
long as anybody complains, or anybody wants anything.
This is the statesmanship of the last quarter of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p id="sec_77">77. Bismarck, too, is going into the business. He has to
rule a people who live on a poor soil and have to bear a
crushing military system. The consequence is that the
population is declining. Emigration exceeds the natural
increase. Bismarck’s cure for it is to lay protective taxes
against American pork and wheat and rye. This will
protect the German agriculturist. If it lowers still more
the comfort of the buyers of food, and drives more of them
out of the country, then he will go and buy or fight for
colonies at the expense of the German agriculturists whom
he has just “protected,” although the surplus population
of Germany has been taking itself away for thirty years
without asking help or giving trouble. What can Germany
gain by diverting her emigrants to her own colony unless
she means to bring the able-bodied men back to fight her
battles? If she means that, the emigrants will not go to
her colony.</p>

<p id="sec_78">78. France is also reviving the old colonial policy with
discriminating favors and compensatory restraints. She
already owns a possession in Algeria, which is the best
example of a colony for the sake of a colony. It has been
asserted in the French Chambers that each French family
now in Algeria has cost the Government (<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the French
taxpayer) 25,000 francs.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The longing of these countries
for “colonies” is like the longing of a negro dandy for a
cane or a tall hat so as to be like the white gentlemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<h5>(<i>B</i>) <span class="smcap">Sugar Bounties.</span></h5>

<p id="sec_79">79. The worst case of all, however, is sugar. The protectionists
long boasted of beet-root sugar as a triumph of
their system. It is now an industry in which an immense
amount of capital is invested on the Continent, but cheap
transportation for cane sugar, and improvements in the
treatment of the latter, are constantly threatening it.
Mention is made in <cite>Bradstreet’s</cite> for June 28, 1885, of a very
important improvement in the treatment of cane which has
just been invented at Berlin. Germany has an excise tax
on beet-root sugar, but allows a drawback on it when exported
which is greater than the tax. This acts as a
bounty paid by the German taxpayer on the exportation.
Consequently, beet-root sugar has appeared even in our
market. The chief market for it, however, is England.
The consequence is that the sugar, which is nine cents a
pound in Germany, and seven cents a pound here, is five
cents a pound in England, and that the annual consumption
of sugar per head in the three countries<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> is as follows:
England, sixty-seven and a half pounds; United States,
fifty-one pounds; Germany, twelve pounds. I sometimes
find it difficult to make people understand the difference between
wanting an “industry” and wanting goods, but this
case ought to make that distinction clear. Obviously <em>the
Germans have the industry and the Englishmen have the sugar</em>.</p>

<p id="sec_80">80. No sooner, however, does Germany get her export
bounty in good working order than the Austrian sugar refiners
besiege their government to know whether Germany
is to have the monopoly of giving sugar to the Englishmen.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
They get a bounty and compete for that privilege. Then
the French refiners say that they cannot compete, and must
be enabled to compete in giving sugar to the Englishmen.
I believe that their case is under favorable consideration.</p>

<p>80<i>a.</i> I have found it harder (as is usually the case) to
get recorded information about the trade and industry of
our own country than about those of foreign nations.
However, we too, although we do not raise beet-sugar,
have our share in this bounty folly, as may be seen by the
following statement, which comes to hand just in time to
serve my purpose.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> “The export of refined sugar [from
the United States] is entirely confined to hard sugars, or,
to be more explicit, loaf, crushed, and granulated. This
is because the drawback upon this class of sugar is so large
that refiners are enabled to sell them at less than cost.
The highest collectable duty upon sugar testing as high
as 99° is but 2.36, but the drawback upon granulated testing
the same, and in the case of crushed and loaf less, is
2.82 less 1 per cent. This is exactly 43 cents per one
hundred pounds more than the government receives in
duty. But it rarely happens that raw sugar is imported
testing 99°, and never for refining purposes. The following
table gives the rates of duty upon the average grades used
in refining:</p>

<table id="t61" class="narrow30" summary="rates of dury in refining">

<p class="in0">It will be clearly seen from the above figures that with a
net drawback upon hard sugar of 2.79 our refiners are able
to sell to foreigners, through the assistance of our Treasury,
sugar at less than cost. Taking, for instance, the net
price of centrifugal testing only 97° and the net price less
drawback of granulated:</p>

<p class="in0">Nothing could demonstrate the absurdity of the present
rate of drawback more clearly than the above. A refiner
pays 6½ cents per hundred more for raw sugar testing 2°
less saccharine than he sells refined for. Not, however, to
the American consumers, but to foreigners. After paying
the expenses necessary to refining by the assistance of
a drawback, which clearly amounts to a subsidy of about
50 cents a hundred pounds, our large sugar monopolists
are assisted by the government to increase the cost of sugar
to American consumers. One firm controls almost the
entire trade of the east; at all events it is safe to say that
the trade of the entire country is controlled by three firms,
and the Treasury assists this monopoly in sustaining prices
against the interest of the country at large. Up to date
the exports of refined sugar have amounted to 83,340 tons,
which, taken at 50 cents a hundred, has cost the treasury
over $830,000. All this may not have gone into the pockets
of the refiners, as the ship owners have obtained a share,
but the fact remains that the Treasury is the loser by this
amount. Besides this bounty presses hard upon the consumers.
They not only have to pay the tax, but during
the late rise they were compelled to pay more for their
sugar than they otherwise would have done had not the
export demand caused by selling sugar to foreigners at less
than cost, the Treasury paying the difference, increased
prices. While an American consumer is charged 6½ cents
for granulated, foreign buyers, through the liberality of
our government, can buy it under 3¾ cents. Certainly it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
is time that the Secretary of the Treasury asked the sugar
commission to commence a comprehensive and impartial
inquiry.”</p>

<p id="sec_81">81. Of course the story would not be complete if the
English refiners did not besiege their government for a
tax to keep out this maleficent gift of foreign taxpayers.
This, say they, is not free trade. This is protection turned
the other way around. We might hold our own on an equal
footing, but we cannot contend against a subsidized industry.
A superficial thinker might say that this protest
was conclusive. The English government set on foot an
investigation, not of the sugar refining, but of <em>those other
interests which were in danger of being forgotten</em>. There was
a tariff investigation which was worth something and was
worthy of an enlightened government. It was found that
the consumers of sugar had gained more than all the wages
paid in sugar refining. But, on the side of the producers,
it was found that 6,000 persons are employed and 45,000
tons of sugar are used annually in the neighborhood of
London in manufacturing jam and confectionery. In
Scotland there are eighty establishments, employing over
4,000 people and using 35,000 tons of sugar per annum in
similar industries. In the whole United Kingdom, in those
industries, 100,000 tons of sugar are used and 12,000 people
are employed, three times as many as in sugar refining.
Within twenty years the confectionery trade of Scotland
has quadrupled and the preserving trade—jam and marmalade—has
practically been originated. In addition,
refined sugar is a raw material in biscuit making and the
manufacture of mineral waters, and 50,000 tons are used
in brewing and distilling. Hence the <cite>Economist</cite> argues
(and this view seems to have controlled the decision): “It
may be that the gain which we at present realize from the
bounties may not be enduring, as it is impossible to believe
that foreign nations will go on taxing themselves to the extent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
of several millions a year in order to supply us and
others with sugar at less than its fair price, but that is no
reason for refusing to avail ourselves of their liberality so
long as it does last.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> (See § <a href="#sec_83">83</a>, note.)</p>

<p id="sec_82">82. One point in this case ought not to be lost sight of.
If the English government had yielded to the sugar refiners
without looking further, all these little industries which
are mentioned, and which in their aggregate are so important,
would have been crushed out. Ten years later
they would have been forgotten. It is from such an example
that one must learn to form a judgment as to <em>the
effect of our tariff in crushing out industries</em> which are now
lost and gone, and cannot even be recalled for purposes of
controversy, but which would spring into existence again if
the repeal of the taxes should give them a chance.</p>

<p id="sec_83">83. On our side the water efforts have been made to get
us into the sugar struggle by the proposed commercial
treaties with Spain and England, which would in effect
have extended our protective tariff around Cuban and
English West Indian sugar.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> The sugar consumers of
the United States were to pay to the Cuban planters the
twenty-five million dollars revenue which they now pay to
the treasury on Cuban sugar, on condition that the Cubans
should bring back part of it and spend it among our manufacturers.
It was a new extension of the plan of taxing
some of us for the benefit of others of us. Let it be noticed,
too, that when it suited their purpose, the protectionists
were ready to sacrifice the sugar industry of Louisiana
without the least concern. We have been trying for
twenty-five years to secure the home market and keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
everybody else out of it. <em>As soon as we get it firmly shut,
so that nobody else can get in, we find that it is a question of
life and death with us to get out ourselves.</em> The next device
is to tax Americans in order to go and buy a piece of the
foreign market. At the last session of Congress Senator
Cameron proposed to allow a drawback on raw materials
used in exported products. On that plan the American
manufacturer would have two costs of production, one
when he was working for the home market, and another
much lower one when working for the foreign market. As
it is now, the exports of manufactured products, of which
so much boasting is heard, are for the most part articles
sold abroad lower than here so as not to break down the
home monopoly market. The proposed plan would raise
that to a system, and we should be giving more presents to
foreigners.</p>

<p id="sec_84">84. To return to sugar, our treaty with the Sandwich
Islands has produced anomalous and mischievous results
on the Pacific coast. In the southern Pacific New Zealand
is just going into the plan of bounties and protection on
sugar.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> It would not, therefore, be very bold to predict
a worldwide catastrophe in the sugar industry within five
years.</p>

<p id="sec_85">85. Now what is it all for? What is it all about? Napoleon
Bonaparte began it in a despotic whim, when he
determined to force the production of beet-root sugar to
show that he did not care for the supremacy of England
at sea which cut him off from the sugar islands. In order
not to lose the capital engaged in the industry, protection
was continued. But this led to putting more capital into
it and further need of protection. The problem has tormented
financiers for seventy-five years. There are two
natural products, of which the cane is far richer in sugar.
But the processes of the beet-sugar industry have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
improved, until recently, far more rapidly than those of the
cane industry. Then the refining is a separate interest.
If, then, a country has cane-sugar colonies which it wants
to protect against other colonies, and a beet-sugar industry
which it wants to protect against neighbors who produce
beet-sugar, and refiners to be protected against foreign refiners,
and if the relations of its own colonial cane-sugar
producers to its own domestic beet-sugar producers must
be kept satisfactorily adjusted, in spite of changes in processes,
transportation, and taxation, and if it wants to get
a revenue from sugar, and to use the colonial trade to develop
its shipping, and if it has two or three commercial
treaties in which sugar is an important item, the statesman
of that country has a task like that of a juggler riding
several horses and keeping several balls in motion. Sugar
is the commodity on which the effects of a world-embracing
commerce, produced by modern inventions, are most
apparent, and it is the commodity through which all the
old protectionist anti-commercial doctrines will be brought
to the most decisive test.</p>

<h5>(<i>C</i>) <span class="smcap">Forced Foreign Relations to Regulate Improvement
which can no Longer be Defeated.</span></h5>

<p id="sec_86">86. If we turn back once more to our own case, we note
the rise in 1883–1884 of the policy of commercial treaties
and of a “vigorous foreign policy.” For years a “national
policy” for us has meant “securing the home market.”
The perfection of this policy has led to isolation and ostentatious
withdrawal from cosmopolitan interests. I may
say that I do not write out of any sympathy with vague
humanitarianism or cosmopolitan sentiments. It seems to
me that local groupings have great natural strength and
obvious utility so long as they are subdivisions of a higher
organization of the human race, or so long as they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
formed freely and their relations to each other are developed
naturally. But now suddenly rises a clap-trap
demand for a “national policy,” which means that we shall
force our way out of our tax-created isolation by diplomacy
or war. The effort, however, is to be restrained carefully
and arbitrarily to the western hemisphere, and we
have anxiously disavowed any part or lot in the regulation
of the Congo, although we shall certainly some day desire
to take our share in the trade of that district. Our statesmen,
however, if they are going to let us have any foreign
trade, cannot bear to let us go and take it where we shall
make most by it. They must draw <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> lines for it.
They have taxed us in order to shut us up at home. This
has killed the carrying trade, for, if we decided not to trade,
what could the shippers find to do? Next ship-building
perished, for if there was no carrying trade why build
ships, especially when the taxes to protect manufactures
were crushing ships and commerce? (§ <a href="#sec_101">101</a>.) Next the
navy declined, for with no commerce to protect at sea, we
need no navy. Next we lost the interest which we took
thirty years ago in a canal across the isthmus, because we
have now, under the no-trade policy, no use for it. Next
diplomacy became a sinecure, for we have no foreign
relations.</p>

<p id="sec_87">87. Now comes the “national policy,” not because it is
needed, but as an artificial and inflated piece of political
bombast. We are to galvanize our diplomacy by contracting
commercial treaties and meddling in foreign quarrels.
No doubt this will speedily make a navy necessary. In
fact our proposed “American policy” is only an old, cast-off,
eighteenth-century, John Bull policy, which has forced
England to keep up a big army, a big navy, heavy debt,
heavy taxes, and a constant succession of little wars. Hence
we shall be taxed some more to pay for a navy. Then it is
proposed to tax us some more to pay for canals through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
which the navy can go. Then we are to be taxed some
more to subsidize merchant ships to go through the canal.
Then we are to be taxed some more to subsidize voyages,
<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the carrying trade. Then we are to be taxed some
more to provide the ships with cargoes (§ <a href="#sec_83">83</a>).</p>

<p id="sec_88">88. All this time, the whole West Indian, Mexican, and
Central and South American trade is ours if we will only
stand out of the way and let it come. It is ours by all
geographical and commercial advantage, and would have
been ours since 1825 if we had but taken down the barriers.
Instead of that we propose to tax ourselves some more to
lift it over the barriers. Take the taxes off goods, let exchange
go on, and the carrying trade comes as a consequence.
If we have goods to carry, we shall build or buy
ships in which to carry them. If we have merchant ships,
we shall need and shall keep up a suitable navy. If we
need canals, we shall build them, as, in fact, private capital
is now building one and taking the risk of it. If we need
diplomacy we shall learn and practice diplomacy of the
democratic, peaceful, and commercial type.</p>

<p id="sec_89">89. Thus, under the philosophy of protectionism, the
very same thing, if it comes to us freely by the extension
of commerce and the march of improvement, is regarded
with terror, while, if we can first bar it out, and then only
let a little of it in at great cost and pains, it is a thing worth
fighting for. Such is the fallacy of all commercial treaties.
The crucial criticism on all the debates at Washington in
1884–1885 was: <em>Have these debaters made up their minds to
any standard by which to measure what you get and what you
give under a commercial treaty?</em> It was plain that they
had not. A generation of protectionism has taken away
the knowledge of what trade is (§§ <a href="#sec_125">125</a>, <a href="#sec_139">139</a>), and whence
its benefits arise, and has created a suspicion of trade
(§§ <a href="#sec_63">63</a> ff.). Hence when our public men came to compare
what we should get and what we should give, they set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
about measuring this by things which were entirely foreign
to it. Scarcely two of them agreed as to the standards by
which to measure it. Some thought that it was the number
of people in one country compared with the number in the
other. Others thought that it was the amount sold to as
compared with the amount bought from the country in
question. Others thought that it was the amount of
revenue to be sacrificed by us as compared with the amount
which would be sacrificed by the other party. If any one
will try to establish a standard by which to measure the
gain by such a treaty to one party or the other, he will be
led to see the fallacy of the whole procedure. The greatest
gain to both would be if the trade were perfectly free.
If it is obstructed more or less, that is a harm to be corrected
as far and as soon as possible. If then either party
lowers its own taxes, that is a gain and a movement toward
the desirable state of things. No state needs anybody’s
permission to lower its own taxes, and entanglements
which would impair its fiscal independence would be a new
harm.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p id="sec_90">90. Protectionism, therefore, is at war with improvement.
It is only useful to annul and offset the effects of
those very improvements of which we boast. In time, the
improvements win power so great that protectionism cannot
withstand them. <em>Then it turns about and tries to control
and regulate them at great expense by diplomacy or war.</em>
The greater and more worldwide these improvements are,
the more numerous are the efforts in different parts of the
world to revive or extend protection. No doubt there is
loss and inconvenience in the changes which improvement
brings about. A notable case is the loss and inconvenience
of a laborer where a machine is first introduced to
supplant him. Patient endurance and hope, in the confidence
that he will in the end be better off, has long been
preached to him. It is true that he will be better off; but
why not apply the same doctrine in connection with the
other inconveniences of improvement, where it is equally
true?</p>

<h4>3. <i>PROTECTION LOWERS WAGES</i>.</h4>

<p id="sec_91">91. On a pure wages system, that is, where there is a
class who have no capital and no land, wages are determined
by supply and demand of labor. The demand for
labor is measured by the capital in hand to pay for it just
as the demand for anything else is measured by the supply
of goods offered in exchange for it. In Cobden’s language:
“When two men are after one boss, wages are low; when
two bosses are after one man, wages are high.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<h5>(<i>A</i>) <span class="smcap">No True Wages Class in the United States.</span></h5>

<p id="sec_92">92. The United States, however, have never yet been
on a pure wages system because there is no class which has
no land or cannot get any. In fact, the cheapening of
transportation which is going on is making the land of this
continent, Australia, and Africa available for the laborers
of Europe, and is breaking down the wages system there.
This is the real reason for the rise of the proletariat and
the expansion of democracy which are generally attributed
to metaphysical, sentimental, or political causes. A man
who has no capital and no land cannot live from day to
day except by getting a share in the capital of others
in return for services rendered. In an old society or dense
population, such a class comes into existence. It has no
reserves; no other chances; no other resource. In a new
country no such class exists. The land is to be had for
going to it. On the stage of agriculture which is there existing
very little capital and very little division of labor
are necessary. Hence he who has only unskilled manual
strength can get at and use the land, and he can get out of
it an abundant supply of the rude primary comforts of existence
for himself and his family. If it is made so cheap and
easy to get from the old centers of population to the new
land that the lowest class of laborers can save enough to
pay the passage, then the effect will reach the labor market
of the old countries also. Such is now the fact.</p>

<p id="sec_93">93. The weakness of a true wages class is in the fact
that they have no other chance. Obviously, however, <em>a
man is well off in this world in proportion to the chances which
he can command</em>. The advantage of education is that it
multiplies a man’s chances. <em>Our</em> noncapitalists have another
chance on the land, and the chance is near and easy to grasp
and use. It is not necessary that all or any number should
use it. Every one who uses it leaves more room behind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
lessens the supply and competition of labor, and helps his
class as a class. The other chance which the laborer possesses
is also a <em>good</em> one, and consequently sets the minimum
of unskilled wages high. Here we have the reason for
high wages in a new country.</p>

<p id="sec_94">94. The relation of things was distinctly visible in the
early colonial days. Winthrop tells how the General Court
in Massachusetts Bay tried to fix the wages of artisans by
law. It is obvious that artisans were in great demand to
build houses, and that they would not work at their trades
unless the wages would buy as good or better living than
the farmers could get out of the ground, for these artisans
could go and take up land and be farmers too. The only
effect of the law was that the artisans “went West” to the
valley of the Connecticut, and the law became a dead
letter. The same equilibration between the gains from
the new land and the wages of artisans and laborers has
been kept up ever since.</p>

<p id="sec_95">95. In 1884 an attempt was made to unite the Eastern
and Western Iron Associations for common effort in behalf
of higher wages. The union could not be formed because
the Eastern and Western Associations <em>never had had the
same rate of wages</em>. The latter, being farther west, where
the supply of labor is smaller and the land nearer, have
obtained higher wages. It may be well to anticipate a
little right here in order to point out that this difference in
wages has not prevented the growth of the industry in
the West, and has not made competition in a common
market impossible.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> The fact is of the first importance to
controvert the current assumption of the protectionists.
They say that an industry cannot be carried on in one
place if the wages there are higher than must be paid by
somebody in the same industry in another place. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
proposition has no foundation in fact at all. Farm laborers
in Iowa get three times the wages of farm laborers in England.
The products of the former pay 5,000 miles transportation,
and then drive out the products of the latter.
Wages are only one element, and often they are far from
being the most important element, in the economy of production.
<em>The wages which are paid to the men who make an
article have nothing to do with the price or value of that article.</em>
This proposition, I know, has a startling effect on the
people who hold to the monkish notions of political economy,
but it is only a special case of the theorem that
“<em>Labor which is past has no effect on value</em>,” which is the
true cornerstone of any sound political economy. Wages
are determined by the supply and demand of labor. Value
is determined by the supply and demand of the commodity.
These two things have no connection. Wages are one element
in the capitalist’s outlay for production. If the total
outlay in one line of production, when compared with the
return obtained in that line, is not as advantageous as the
total outlay in another line when compared with the return
available in the second line, then the capital is withdrawn
from the first line and put into the second; but the rate of
wages in either case or any case is the market rate, determined
by the supply and demand of labor, for that is what
the employers must pay if they want the men, whether
they are making any profits or not.</p>

<p id="sec_96">96. The facts and economic principles just stated above
show plainly why wages are high, and put in strong light
the assertion of the protectionists that their device makes
wages high (§ <a href="#sec_47">47</a>), that is, higher than they would be otherwise,
or higher here than they are in Europe. Wages are
not arbitrary. They cannot be shifted up and down at
anybody’s whim. They are controlled by ultimate causes.
If not, then what has made them fall during the last eighteen
months, ten to forty per cent, most in the most protected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
industries (§ <a href="#sec_26">26</a>)? Why are they highest in the least
protected and the unprotected industries, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, the building
trades? Hod-carriers recently struck in New York for
three dollars for nine hours’ work. Where did the tariff
touch their case? <em>Why does not the tariff prevent the fall in
wages?</em> It is all there, and now is the time for it to come
into operation, if it can keep wages up. Now it is needed.
When wages were high in the market, and it was not
needed, it claimed the credit. Now when they fall and it is
needed, it is powerless.</p>

<p id="sec_97">97. Wages are capital. If I promise to pay wages I
must find capital somewhere with which to fulfill my contract.
If the tariff makes me pay more than I otherwise
would, where does the surplus come from? Disregarding
money as only an intermediate term, a man’s wages are his
means of subsistence—food, clothing, house rent, fuel,
lights, furniture, etc. If the tariff system makes him get
more of these for ten hours’ work in a shop than he would
get without tariff, <em>where does the “more” come from</em>? Nothing
but labor and capital can produce food, clothing, etc.
Either the tax must make these out of nothing, or it can
only get them by taking them from those who have made
them, that is by subtracting them from the wages of somebody
else. Taking all the wages class into account, then
the tax cannot possibly increase, but is sure by waste and
loss to decrease wages.</p>

<h5>(<i>B</i>) <span class="smcap">How Taxes Do Act on Wages.</span></h5>

<p id="sec_98">98. If taxes are to raise wages they must be laid not on
goods but on men. Let the goods be abundant and the
men scarce. Then the average wages will be high, for the
supply of labor will be small and the demand great. If
we tax goods and not men, the supply of labor will be great,
the demand will be limited, and the wages will be low.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Here we see why employers of labor want a tariff. For it
is an obvious inconsistency and a most grotesque satire
that the same men should tell the workmen at home that
the tariff makes wages high, and should go to Washington
and tell Congress that they want a tariff because the wages
are too high. We have found that the high wages of American
laborers have independent causes and guarantees, outside
of legislation. They are provided and maintained by
the economic circumstances of the country. This is against
the interest of those who want to hire the laborers. No
device can serve their interest unless it lowers wages.
From the standpoint of an employer the fortunate circumstances
of the laborer become an obstacle to be overcome
(§ <a href="#sec_65">65</a>). The laborer is too well off. Nothing can do any
good which does not make him less well off. The competition
which troubles the employer is not the “pauper labor”
of Europe.</p>

<p id="sec_99">99. “Pauper labor” had a meaning in the first half of
this century, in England, when the overseers of the poor
turned over the younger portion of the occupants of the
poorhouses to the owners of the new cotton factories, under
contracts to teach them the trade and pay them a pittance.
Of course the arrangement had shocking evils connected
with it, but it was a transition arrangement. The “pauper
laborers’” children, after a generation, became independent
laborers; the system expired of itself, and “pauper
laborer” is now a senseless jingle.</p>

<p id="sec_100">100. The competition which the employers fear <i>is the
competition of those industries in America which can pay the
high wages and which keep the wages high because they do pay
them</i>. These draw the laborer away. These offer him
another chance. If he had no other way of earning more
than he is earning, it would be idle for him to demand
more. The reason why he demands more and gets it is
because he knows where he can get it, if he cannot get it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
where he is. If, then, he is to be brought down, the only
way to do it is <i>to destroy, or lessen the value of, his other
chance</i>. This is just what the tariff does.</p>

<p id="sec_101">101. The taxes which are laid for protection must come
out of somebody. As I have shown (§§ <a href="#sec_32">32</a> ff.) the protected
interests give and take from each other, but, if they as a
group win anything, they must win from another group,
and that other group must be the industries which are not
and cannot be protected. In England these were formerly
manufactures and they were taxed, under the corn laws,
for the benefit of agriculture. In the United States, of
course, the case must be complementary and opposite. We
tax agriculture and commerce to benefit manufactures.
Commerce, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the ship-building and carrying trade, has
been crushed out of existence by the burden (§ <a href="#sec_86">86</a>). But
the burden thus thrown on agriculture and commerce lowers
the gains of those industries, lessens the attractiveness of
them to the laborer, lessens the value of the laborer’s other
chance, lessens the competition of other American industries
with manufacturing, and so, by taking away from the
blessing which God and nature have given to the American
laborer, enable the man who wants to hire his services to
get them at a lower rate. The effect of taxes is just the
same as such a percentage taken from the fertility of the
soil, the excellence of the climate, the power of tools, or
the industrious habits of the people. Hence it reduces
the average comfort and welfare of the population, and
with that average comfort it carries down the wages of
such persons as work for wages.</p>

<h5>(<i>C</i>) <span class="smcap">Perils of Statistics, Especially of Wages.</span></h5>

<p id="sec_102">102. Any student of statistics will be sure to have far
less trust in statistics than the uninitiated entertain. The
bookkeepers have taught us that figures will not lie, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
that they will tell very queer stories. Statistics will not lie,
but they will play wonderful tricks with a man who does
not understand their dialect. The unsophisticated reader
finds it difficult, when a column of statistics is offered to
him, to resist the impression that they must prove <em>something</em>.
The fact is that a column of statistics hardly ever
proves anything. It is a popular opinion that anybody
can use or understand statistics. The fact is that a special
and high grade of skill is required to appreciate the effect
of the collateral circumstances under which the statistics
were obtained, to appreciate the limits of their application,
and to interpret their significance. The statistics which
are used to prove national prosperity are an illustration
of this, for they are used as absolute measures when it is
plain that they have no use except for a comparison. Sometimes
the other term of the comparison is not to be found
and it is always ignored (§ <a href="#sec_52">52</a>).</p>

<p id="sec_103">103. A congressional committee in the winter of 1883–1884,
dealing with the tariff, took up the census and proceeded
to reckon up the wages in steel production by adding all the
wages from the iron mine up. Then they took bar iron and
added all the wages from the bottom up again, in order to
find the importance of the wages element in that, and so
on with every stage of iron industry. They were going to
add in the same wages six or eight times over.</p>

<p id="sec_104">104. The statistics of comparative wages which are published
are of no value at all.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> It is not known how, or by
whom, or from what selected cases, they were collected.
It is not known how wide, or how long, or how thorough
was the record from which they were taken. The facts
about various classifications of labor in the division of labor,
and about the rate at which machinery is run, or about the
allowances of one kind and another which vary from mill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
to mill and town to town are rarely specified at all. Protected
employers are eager to tell the wages they pay per
day or week, which are of no importance. The only statistics
which would be of any use for the comparison which
is attempted would be such as show the proportion of wages
to total cost per unit. Even this comparison would not
have the force which is attributed to the other. Hence the
statistics offered are worthless or positively misleading. In
the nature of the case such statistics are extremely hard to
get. If application is made to the employers, the inquiry
concerns their private business. They have no interest in
answering. They cannot answer without either spending
great labor on their books (if the inquiry covers a period),
or surrendering their books to some one else, if they allow
him to do the labor. If inquiry is made of the men, it becomes
long and tedious and full of uncertainties. Do
United States Consuls take the trouble involved in such an
inquiry? Have they the training necessary to conduct it
successfully?</p>

<p id="sec_105">105. The fact is generally established and is not disputed
that wages are higher here than in Europe. The difference
is greatest on the lowest grade of labor—manual labor,
unskilled labor. The difference is less on higher grades of
labor. For what the English call “engineers,” men who
possess personal dexterity and creative power, the difference
is the other way, if we compare the United States and
England. The returns of immigration reflect these differences
exactly (§ <a href="#sec_122">122</a>, note). The great body of the immigrants
consists of farmers and laborers. The “skilled
laborers” are comparatively a small class, and, if the claims
of the individuals to be what they call themselves were
tested by English or German trade standards, the number
would be very small indeed. Engineers emigrate from
Germany to England. Men of that class rarely come to
this country, or, if they come, they come under special contracts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
or soon return. Each country, spite of all taxes
and other devices, gets the class of men for which its industrial
condition offers the best chances. The only thing the
tariff does in the matter is to take from those who have an
advantage here a part of that advantage.</p>

<h4>4. <i>PROTECTIONISM IS SOCIALISM</i></h4>

<p id="sec_106">106. Simply to give protectionism a bad name would
be to accomplish very little. When I say that protectionism
is socialism I mean to classify it and bring it not only under
the proper heading but into relation with its true affinities.
<em>Socialism is any device or doctrine whose aim is to save individuals
from any of the difficulties or hardships of the struggle
for existence and the competition of life by the intervention of
“the State.”</em> Inasmuch as “the State” never is or can be
anything but some other people, socialism is a device for
making some people fight the struggle for existence for
others. The devices always have a doctrine behind them
which aims to show why this <em>ought</em> to be done.</p>

<p id="sec_107">107. The protected interests demand that they be saved
from the trouble and annoyance of business competition,
and that they be assured profits in their undertakings, by
“the State,” that is, at the expense of their fellow-citizens.
If this is not socialism, then there is no such thing. If
employers may demand that “the State” shall guarantee
them profits, why may not the employees demand that
“the State” shall guarantee them wages? If we are taxed
to provide profits, why should we not be taxed for public
workshops, for insurance to laborers, or for any other
devices which will give wages and save the laborer from
the annoyances of life and the risks and hardships of the
struggle for existence? The “we” who are to pay changes
all the time, and the turn of the protected employer to pay
will surely come before long. The plan of all living on each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
other is capable of great expansion. It is, as yet, far from
being perfected or carried out completely. The protectionists
are only educating those who are as yet on the
“paying” side of it, but who will certainly use political
power to put themselves also on the “receiving” side of it.
The argument that “the State” must do something for me
because my business does not pay, is a very far-reaching
argument. If it is good for pig iron and woolens, it is good
for all the things to which the socialists apply it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter IV</span><br />

<span class="subhead">SUNDRY FALLACIES OF PROTECTIONISM</span></h3>

<p id="sec_108">108. I can now dispose rapidly of a series of current
fallacies put forward by the protectionists. They generally
are fanciful or far-fetched attempts to show some equivalent
which the taxpayer gets for his taxes.</p>

<h4>(<i>A</i>) <span class="smcap">That Infant Industries can be Nourished up to
Independence and that they then Become Productive.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_109">109. I know of no case where this hope has been realized,
although we have been trying the experiment for
nearly a century. The weakest infants to-day are those
whom Alexander Hamilton set out to protect in 1791. As
soon as the infants begin to get any strength (if they ever
do get any) the protective system forces them to bear the
burden of other infants, and so on forever. The system
superinduces hydrocephalus on the infants, and instead of
ever growing to maturity, the longer they live, the bigger
babies they are. It is the system which makes them so,
and on its own plan it can never rationally be expected to
have any other effect. (See further, under the next fallacy,
§§ <a href="#sec_111">111</a> ff.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p id="sec_110">110. Mill<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> makes a statement of a case, as within the
bounds of conceivability, where there might be an advantage
for a young country to protect an infant industry. He is
often quoted without regard to the limitation of his statement,
as if he had affirmed the general expediency of protection
in new countries and for infant industries. It
amounts to a misquotation to quote him without regard
to the limitations which he specified. The statement which
he did make is mathematically demonstrable.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The doctrine
so developed is very familiar in private enterprise. A
business enterprise may be started which for some years
will return no profits or will occasion losses, but which is
expected later to recoup all these. <em>What are the limits within
which such an enterprise can succeed?</em> It must either call
for sinking capital only for a short period (like building a
railroad or planting an orange grove), or it must promise
enormous gains after it is started (like a patented novelty).
The higher the rate of interest, as in any new country, the
more stringent and narrow these conditions are. Mill said
that it was conceivable that a case of an industry might
occur in which this same calculation might be applied to
a protective tax. If, then, anybody says that he can offer
an industry which meets the conditions, let it be examined
to see if it does so. If protection is never applied until such
a case is offered, it will never be applied at all. A thing
which is mathematically conceivable is one which is not
absurd; but a thing which is practically possible is quite
another thing. For myself, I strenuously dissent from
Mill’s doctrine even as he limits it. In the first place the
state cannot by taxes work out an industrial enterprise of
a character such that it, as any one can see, <em>demands the
most intense and careful oversight by persons whose capital is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
at stake in it</em>, and, in the second place, the state would bear
the loss, while it lasted, but private interests would take
the gain after it began.</p>

<h4>(<i>B</i>) <span class="smcap">That Protective Taxes do not Raise Prices
but Lower Prices.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_111">111. To this it is obvious to reply: what good can they
then do toward the end proposed? Still it is true that,
under circumstances, protective taxes do lower prices. The
protectionist takes an infant industry in hand and proposes
to rear it by putting on taxes to ward off competition, and
by giving it more profits than the world’s market price
would give. This raises the price. But the consumer then
raises a complaint. The protectionist turns to him and
promises that by and by there will be “overproduction,”
and prices will fall. This arrives in due time, for every
protected industry is organized as a more or less limited
monopoly, and a monopoly which has overproduced its
market, <em>at the price which it wants</em>, is the weakest industry
possible (§ <a href="#sec_24">24</a>). The consumer now wins, but a wail from
the cradle calls the protectionist back to the infant industry,
which is in convulsions from “overproduction.” Some
of the infants die. This gives a new chance to the others.
They combine for more effective monopoly, put the prices
up again by limiting production, and go on until “overproduction”
produces a new collapse. This is another
reason why infants never win vitality. The net result is
that the market is in constant alternations of stringency
and laxity, and nothing at all is gained.</p>

<p id="sec_112">112. Whenever we talk of prices <em>it should be noticed that
our statements involve money</em>—the rate at which goods
exchange for money. If then we want to raise prices, we
must <em>restrict the supply</em> of goods, so that on the doctrine of
money also we shall come to the same result as before, that
protective taxes lessen production and diminish wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p id="sec_113">113. The problem of managing any monopoly is to dose
the market with just the quantity which it will take at the
price which the monopolist wants to get. In a qualified
monopoly, that is, one which is shared by a number of
persons, the difficulty is to get agreement about the management.
They may not have any communication with
each other and may compete. If so they will overdose the
market and the price will fall. Then they meet, to establish
communication; form an “association,” to get harmonious
action, and agree to divide the production among
them and limit and regulate it, to prevent the former mistake
and restore prices (§ <a href="#sec_24">24</a>).</p>

<h4>(<i>C</i>) <span class="smcap">That we should be a Purely Agricultural
Nation under Free Trade.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_114">114. A purely agricultural nation covering a territory as
large as that of the United States is inconceivable. The
distribution of industries now <em>inside</em> the United States is
a complete proof that no such thing would come to pass,
for we have absolute free trade inside, and manufactures
are growing up in the agricultural states just as fast as
circumstances favor, and just as fast as they can be profitably
carried on. Under free trade there would be a subdivision
of cotton, woolen, iron and other industries, and
we should both export and import different varieties and
qualities of these goods. The southern states are now manufacturing
coarse cottons in competition with New England.
The western states manufacture coarse woolens, certain
grades of leather and iron goods, etc., in competition with
the East. Here we see the exact kind of differentiation
which would take place under free trade, and we can see
the mischief of the tariff, whether on the one hand it strikes
a whole category with the same brutal ignorance, or tries,
by cunning sub-classification, to head off every effort to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
save itself which the trade makes.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> If, however, it was
conceivable that we should become a purely agricultural
nation, the only legitimate inference would be that our
whole population could be better supported in that way
than in any other. If there was a greater profit in something
else some of them would go into it.</p>

<h4>(<i>D</i>) <span class="smcap">That Communities which Manufacture are More
Prosperous than those which are Agricultural.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_115">115. This is as true as if it should be said that all tall
men are healthy. It would be answered that some are
and some are not; that tallness and health have no connection.
Some manufacturing communities are prosperous
and some not. The self-contradiction of protectionism
appears in one of its boldest forms in this fallacy. We are
told that manufactures are a special blessing. The protectionist
says that he is going to give us some. Instead
of that he makes new demands on us, lays a new burden
on us, gives us nothing but more taxes. He promises us
an income and increases our expenditure; promises an
asset and gives a liability; promises a gift and creates a
debt; promises a blessing and gives a burden. The very
thing which he boasts of as a great and beneficial advantage
gives us nothing, but takes from us more. Prosperity
is no more connected with one form of industry than
another. If it were so, some of mankind would have, by
nature, a permanently better chance than others, and no
one could emigrate to a new, that is agricultural country,
without injuring his interests. The world is not made so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<h4>(<i>E</i>) <span class="smcap">That it is an Object to Diversify Industry, and
that Nations which have Various Industries are
Stronger than Others which have not Various
Industries.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_116">116. It is not an object to diversify industry, but to
multiply and diversify our satisfactions, comforts, and enjoyments.
If we can do this by unifying our industry, in
greater measure than by diversifying it, then we should
do, and we will do, the former. It is not a question to be
decided <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i>, but depends upon economic circumstances.
If a country has a supremacy in some one industry it will
have only one. California and Australia had only one industry
until the gold mines declined in productiveness, that
is, until their supreme advantage over other countries was
diminished: they began to diversify when they began to
be less well off. The oil region of Pennsylvania has a chance
of three industries, the old farming industry, coal, and oil.
It will have only one industry so long as oil gives chances
superior to those enjoyed by any other similar district.
When it loses its unique advantage by nature it will diversify.
The “strongest” nation is the one which brings products
into the world’s market which are of high demand,
but which cost it little toil and sacrifice to get; for it will
then have command of all the good things which men can
get on earth at little effort to itself. Whether the products
which it offers are one or numerous is immaterial. All the
tariff has to do with it is that when the American comes
into the world’s market with wheat, cotton, tobacco, and
petroleum, all objects of high demand by mankind and
little cost to him, it forces him to forego a part of his due
advantage (§§ <a href="#sec_125">125</a>, <a href="#sec_134">134</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<h4>(<i>F</i>) <span class="smcap">That Manufactures Give Value to Land.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_117">117. This doctrine issued from the Agricultural Bureau.
It has been thought a grand development of the protectionist
argument. It is a simple logical fallacy based on
some misconstrued statistics. The value of land depends
on supply and demand. The demand for land is population.
Hence where the population is dense the value
of land is great. Manufactures can be carried on only
where there is a supply of labor, that is, where the population
is dense. Hence high value of land and manufacturing
industry are common results of dense population. The
statistician of the Agricultural Bureau connected them with
each other as cause and effect, and the New York <cite>Tribune</cite>
said that it was the grandest contribution to political
economy since “the fingers of Horace Greeley stiffened in
death”; which was true.</p>

<p id="sec_118">118. If manufactures spring up spontaneously out of
original strength, and by independent development, of
course they “add value to land,” that is to say, the district
has new industrial power and every interest in it is benefited;
but if the manufactures have to be protected, paid
for, and supported, they do not do any good as manufactures
but only as a device for drawing capital from elsewhere,
as tribute. In this way, protective taxes do alter
the comparative value of land in different districts. This
effect can be seen under some astonishing phases in Connecticut
and other manufacturing states. The farmers are
taxed to hire some people to go and live in manufacturing
villages and carry on manufacturing there. This displacement
of population, brought about at the expense of the
rural population, diminishes the value of agricultural land
and raises that of city land right here within the same
state. The hillside population is being impoverished, and
the hillside farms are being abandoned on account of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
tribute levied on them to swell the value of mill sites and
adjoining land in the manufacturing towns (§§ <a href="#sec_120">120</a>, <a href="#sec_137">137</a>).</p>

<h4>(<i>G</i>) <span class="smcap">That the Farmer, if he Pays Taxes to Bring into
Existence a Factory, which would not otherwise
Exist, will Win more than the Taxes by Selling
Farm Produce to the Artisans.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_119">119. This is an arithmetical fallacy. It proposes to get
three pints out of a quart. The farmer is out for the tax
and the farm produce and he can not get back more than
the tax because, if the factory owes its existence to the
protective taxes, it cannot make any profit outside of the
taxes. The proposition to the farmer is that he shall pay
taxes to another man who will bring part of the tax back
to buy produce with it. This is to make the farmer rich.
The man who owned stock in a railroad and who rode on it,
paying his fare, in the hope of swelling his own dividends,
was wise compared with a farmer who believes that protection
can be a source of gain to him.</p>

<p id="sec_120">120. Since, as I have shown (§ <a href="#sec_101">101</a>), protective taxes
act like a reduction in the fertility of the soil, they lower
the “margin of cultivation,” and raise rent. They do not,
however, raise it in favor of the agricultural land owner,
for, by the displacement just described, they take away
from him to give to the town land owner. Of course, I do
not believe that the protective taxes have really lowered
the margin of cultivation in this country, for they have
not been able to offset the greater richness of the newest
land, and the advance in the arts. What protection costs
us comes out of the exuberant bounty of nature to us.
Still I know of very few who could not stand it to be a
great deal better off than they are, and the New England
farmer is the one who has the least chance, and the fewest
advantages, with which to endure protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<h4>(<i>H</i>) <span class="smcap">That Farmers Gain by Protection, because it
Draws so many Laborers out of Competition with
them.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_121">121. Since the farmers pay the taxes by which this
operation is supposed to be produced, a simple question is
raised, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, how much can one afford to pay to buy off competition
in his business? He cannot afford to pay anything
unless he has a monopoly which he wants to consolidate.
Our farmers are completely open to competition on every
side. The immigration of farmers every three or four years
exceeds all the workers in all the protected trades. Hence
the farmers, if they take the view which is recommended
to them, instead of gaining any ground, are face to face
with a task which gets bigger and bigger the longer they
work at it. If one man should support another in order
to get rid of the latter’s competition as a producer, that
would be the case where the taxpayer supports soldiers,
idle pensioners, paupers, etc. A protected manufacturer,
however, by the hypothesis, is not simply supported in
idleness, but he is carrying on a business the losses of which
must be paid by those who buy off his competition in their
own production. On the other hand, when farmers come
to market, they are in free competition with several other
sources of supply. Hence, if they did any good to agricultural
industry by hiring the artisans to go out of competition
with them, they would have to share the gain
with all their competitors the world over while paying all
the expense of it themselves.</p>

<p id="sec_122">122. The movement of men over the earth and the
movement of goods over the earth are complementary
operations. Passports to stop the men and taxes to stop
the goods would be equally legitimate. Since it is, once
for all, a fact that some parts of the earth have advantages
for one thing and other parts for other things, men avail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
themselves of the local advantages either by moving themselves
to the places, or by trading what they produce where
they are for what others produce in the other places. The
passenger trains and the freight trains are set in motion
by the same ultimate economic fact. Our exports are all
bulky and require more tonnage than our imports. On
the westward trip, consequently, bunks are erected and
men are brought in space where cotton, wheat, etc., were
taken out. The tariff, by so much as it lessens the import
of goods, leaves room which the ship owners are eager to
fill with immigrants. To do this they lower the rates.
Hence the tariff is a premium on immigration. The protectionists
have claimed that the tariff does favor immigration.
But nine-tenths of the immigrants are laborers,
domestic servants, and farmers.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Probably more than one-third
of the total number, including women, find their way
to the land. As we have seen, the tariff also lowers the
profits of agriculture, which discourages immigration and
the movement to the land. Therefore, if the farmer believes
what the protectionist tells him, he must understand
that the taxes he pays bring in more people, and raise the
value of land by settling it, and that they also bring more
competition, which the farmer must buy off by lowering
the profits of his own (the farming) industry. Then, too,
so far as the immigrants are artisans, the premium on immigration
is a tax paid to increase the supply of labor, that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
to lower wages, although the protectionists say that the
tariff raises wages. Hence we see that when a tax is laid,
in our modern complicated society, instead of being a simple
and easy means or method to be employed for a specific
purpose, its action and reaction on transportation, land,
wages, etc., will produce erratic, contradictory, and confused
effects, which cannot be predicted or analyzed thoroughly,
and the protectionist, when he pleads three or four
arguments for his system, is alleging three or four features
of it which, if properly analyzed and brought together, are
found to be mutually destructive, and cumulative only as
to the mischief they do (see §§ <a href="#sec_29">29</a>, <a href="#sec_101">101</a>).</p>

<h4>(<i>I</i>) <span class="smcap">That our Industries would Perish without
Protection.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_123">123. Those who say this think only of manufacturing
establishments as “industries.” They also talk of “our”
industries. They mean those we support by the taxes we
pay; not those from which we get dividends. No industry
will ever be given up except in order to take up a better
one, and if, under free trade, any of our industries should
perish, it would only be because the removal of restrictions
enabled some other industry to offer so much better rewards
that labor and capital would seek the latter. It is plain
that, if a man does not know of any better way to earn his
living than the one in which he is, he must remain in that,
or move to some other place. If any one can suppose that
the population of the United States could be forced, by
free trade, to move away, he must suppose that this country
cannot support its population, and that we made a
mistake in coming here. This argument is especially full of
force if the articles to be produced are coal, iron, wool,
copper, timber, or any other primary products of the soil.
For, if it is said that we cannot raise these products of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
soil in competition with some other part of the earth’s surface,
all it proves is that we have come to the wrong spot
to seek them. If, however, the soil can support the population
under an arrangement by which certain industries
support themselves, and those which do not pay besides,
then it is plain that the former are really supporting the
whole population—part directly and part indirectly,
through a circuitous and wasteful organization. Hence
the same strong and independent industries could certainly
still better support the whole population, if they
supported it directly.</p>

<p id="sec_124">124. I have been asked whether we should have had
any steel works in this country, if we had had no protection.
I reply that I do not know; neither does anybody else, but
it is certain that we should have had a great deal more steel,
if we had had no protection.</p>

<p id="sec_125">125. “But,” it is said, “we should import everything.”
Should we import everything and give nothing? If so,
foreigners would make us presents and support us. Should
we give equal value in exchange? If so, there would be just
as much “industry” and a great deal less “work” in that
way of getting things than in making them ourselves. The
moment that ceased to be true we should make and not
buy. Suppose that a district, A, has two million inhabitants,
one million of whom produce a million bushels of
wheat, and one million produce a million hundredweight
of iron; and suppose that a bushel of wheat exchanges for
a hundredweight of iron. Now, by improved transportation
and emigration, suppose that a new wheat country, B,
is opened, and that its people bring wheat to the first district,
offering two bushels for a hundredweight of iron.
Plainly they must offer more than one bushel for one hundredweight,
or it is useless for them to come. Now the
people of A, by putting all their labor and capital in iron
production, produce two million hundredweight. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
keep one million hundredweight, and exchange one million
hundredweight of iron for two million bushels of wheat.
The destruction of their wheat industry is a sign of a change
in industry (unifying and not diversifying) by which they
have gained a million bushels of wheat. Such is the gain of
all trade. If the gain did not exist, trade would not be a
feature of civilization.</p>

<h4>(<i>J</i>) <span class="smcap">That it would be Wise to Call into Existence
Various Industries, even at an Expense, if we could
thus Offer Employment to all Kinds of Artisans,
etc., who might Come to us.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_126">126. This would be only maintaining public workshops
at the expense of the taxpayers, and would be open to all
the objections which are conclusive against public workshops.
The expense would be prodigious, and the return
little or nothing. This argument shows less sense of comparative
cost and gain than any other which is ever proposed.</p>

<h4>(<i>K</i>) <span class="smcap">That we Want to be Complete in ourselves and
Sufficient to ourselves, and Independent, as a
Nation, which State of Things will be Produced
by Protection.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_127">127. I will only refer to what I have already said about
China and Japan (§ <a href="#sec_69">69</a>) as types of what this plan produces.
If a number of families from among us should be shipwrecked
on an island, their greatest woe would be that
they could not trade with the rest of the world. They
might live there “self-contained” and “independent,” fulfilling
the ideal of happiness which this proposition offers,
but they would look about them to see a surfeit of things
which, as they know, their friends at home would like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
have, and they would think of all the old comforts which
they used to have, and which they could not produce on
their island. They might be contented to live on there
and make it their home, if they could exchange the former
things for the latter. If now a ship should chance that
way and discover them and should open communication
and trade between them and their old home, a protectionist
philosopher would say to them: “You are making a great
mistake. You ought to make everything for yourselves.
The wise thing to do would be to isolate yourselves again
by taxes as soon as possible.” We sent some sages to the
Japanese to induct them into the ways of civilization, who,
as a matter of fact, did tell them that the first step in civilization
was to adopt a protective tariff and shut up again
by taxes the very ports which they had just opened.</p>

<h4>(<i>L</i>) <span class="smcap">That Protective Taxes are Necessary to Prevent
a Foreign Monopoly from Getting Control of
our Market.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_128">128. It is said that English manufacturers once combined
to lower prices in order to kill out American manufactures,
and that they then put up their prices to monopoly
rates. If they did this, why did not their other customers
send to the United States and buy the goods here in the
first instance, and why did not the Americans go and buy
the goods of the Englishmen’s other customers in the second
instance? If the Englishmen put down their prices for their
whole market in the first instance, why did they not incur
a great loss? and, if they raised it for their whole market
in the second instance, why did they not yield the entire
market to their competitors? The Englishmen are said
to be wonderfully shrewd, and are here credited with the
most stupid and incredible folly.</p>

<p id="sec_129">129. The protective system puts us certainly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
hands of a home monopoly for fear of the impossible chance
that we may fall into the hands of a foreign monopoly.
Before the war we made no first quality thread. We got
it at four cents a spool (retail) of an English monopoly.
Under the tariff we were saved from this by being put into
the hands of a home monopoly which charged five cents
a spool. In the meantime the foreign monopoly lowered
thread to three cents a spool (retail) for the Canadians,
who were at its mercy. Lest we should have to buy nickel
of a foreign monopolist, Congress forced us to buy it of the
owner of the only mine in the United States, and added
thirty cents a pound to any price the foreigner might ask.</p>

<h4>(<i>M</i>) <span class="smcap">That Free Trade is Good in Theory but Impossible
in Practice; that it would be a Good Thing if
All Nations would have it.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_130">130. That a thing can be true in theory and false in practice
is the most utter absurdity that human language can
express. For, if a thing is true in practice (protectionism,
for instance) the theory of its truth can be found, and that
theory will be true. But it was admitted that free trade
is true in theory. Hence two things which are contradictory
would both be true at the same time about the same
thing. The fact is, that <em>protectionism is totally impracticable</em>.
It does not work as it is expected to work; it does not
produce any of the results which were promised from it;
it is never properly and finally established to the satisfaction
of its own votaries. They cannot let it alone. They
always want to “correct inequalities,” or revise it one way
or another. It was they who got up the Tariff Commission
of 1882. Their system is not capable of construction so
as to furnish a normal and regular status for industry. One
of them said that the tariff would be all right if it could only
be made stable; another said that it ought to be revised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
every two years. One said that it ought to include everything;
another said that it would be good “if it was only
laid on the right things.”</p>

<p id="sec_131">131. If all nations had free trade, no one of them would
have any special gain from it, just as, if all men were honest,
honesty would have no commercial value. Some say that
a man cannot afford to be honest unless everybody is honest.
The truth is that, if there was one honest man among
a lot of cheats, his character and reputation would reach
their maximum value. So the nation which has free trade
when the others do not have it gains the most by comparison
with them. It gains while they impoverish themselves.
If all had free trade all would be better off, but then no one
would profit from it more than others. If this were not
true, if the man who first sees the truth and first acts wisely
did not get a special premium for it, the whole moral order
of the universe would have to be altered, for no reform or
improvement could be tried until unanimous consent was
obtained. If a man or a nation does right, the rewards of
doing right are obtained. They are not as great as could
be obtained if all did right, but they are greater than those
enjoy who still do wrong.</p>

<h4>(<i>N</i>) <span class="smcap">That Trade is WAR, so that Free Trade Methods
are Unfit for it, and that Protective Taxes are
Suited to it.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_132">132. It is evidently meant by this that trade involves a
struggle or contest of competition. It might, however, as
well be said that practicing law is war, because it is contentious;
or that practicing medicine is war, because doctors
are jealous rivals of each other. The protectionists do,
however, always seem to think of trade as commercial war.
One of them was reported to have said in a speech, in the
late campaign, that nations would not fight any more with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
guns but with taxes. The nations are to boycott each
other. One would think that the experience our Southerners
made of that notion in the Civil War, upon which they
entered in the faith that “cotton is king,” would have
sufficed to banish forever that antique piece of imbecility,
a commercial war. If trade is war, all the tariff can do
about it is to make A fight B’s battles, although A has his
own battles to fight besides.</p>

<h4>(<i>O</i>) <span class="smcap">That Protection Brings into Employment Labor
and Capital which would otherwise be Idle.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_133">133. If there is any labor or capital which is idle, that
fact is a symptom of industrial disease; especially is this
true in the United States. If a laborer is idle he is in danger
of starving to death. If capital is idle it is producing nothing
to its owner, who depends on it, and is suffering loss.
Therefore, if labor or capital is idle, some antecedent error
or folly must have produced a stoppage in the industrial
organization. The cure is, not to lay some more taxes, but
to find the error and correct it. If then things are in their
normal and healthy condition, the labor and capital of the
country are employed as far as possible under the existing
organization. We are constantly trying to improve our
exchange and credit systems so as to keep all our capital
all the time employed. Such improvements are important
and valuable, but to make them cost more thought and
skillful labor than to invent machines. Hence Congress
cannot do that work by discharging a volley of taxes at
selected articles, and leaving those taxes to find out the
proper points to affect, and to exert the proper influence.
It takes intelligent and hard-working men to do it. The
faith that anything else can do it is superstition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<h4>(<i>P</i>) <span class="smcap">That a Young Nation Needs Protection and will
Suffer some Disadvantage in Free Exchange with
an Old One.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_134">134. The younger a nation is the more important trade
is to it (cf. §§ <a href="#sec_127">127</a> ff.). The younger a nation is the more it
wins by trade, for it offers food and raw materials which
are objects of greatest necessity to old nations. The things
England buys of us are far more essential to her than what
she buys of France or Germany. The strong party in an
exchange is not the rich party, or the old party, but the
one who is favored by supply and demand—the one who
brings to the exchange the thing which is more rare and
more eagerly wanted.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> If a poor woman went into Stewart’s
store to buy a yard of calico, she did not have to pay more
because Stewart was rich. She paid less because he used
his capital to serve her better and at less price than anybody
else could. England takes 60 per cent of all our exports.
We sell, first, wheat and provisions, prime articles
of food; second, cotton, the most important raw material
now used by mankind; third, tobacco, the most universal
luxury and the one for which there is the intensest demand;
fourth, petroleum, the lighting material in most universal
use. These are things which are rare and of high demand.
We are, therefore, strong in the market. Protection only
robs us of part of our advantage (§ <a href="#sec_116">116</a>).</p>

<h4>(<i>Q</i>) <span class="smcap">That we Need Protection to Get Ready for
War.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_135">135. We have no army, or navy, or fortifications worth
mentioning. We are wasting more by protective taxes in
a year than would be necessary to build a first-class navy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
and fortify our whole seacoast. It is said that, in some way,
the taxes get us ready for war, and yet in fact we are not
ready for war. It is plain that this argument is only a
pretense put forward to try to cover the real motives of
protection. If we prefer to go without army, navy, and
fortifications, as we now do, then the best way to get ready
for war, consistently with that policy, is <em>to get as rich as we
can</em>. Then we can count on buying anything in the world
which anybody else has got and which we need. Protection,
then, which lessens our wealth, is only diminishing our
power for war.</p>

<h4>(<i>R</i>) <span class="smcap">That Protectionism Produces some Great
Moral Advantages.</span></h4>

<p id="sec_136">136. It is a very suspicious thing when a man who sets
out to discuss an economic question shifts over on the
“moral” ground. Not because economics and morals have
nothing to do with each other. On the contrary, they meet
at a common boundary line, and, when both are sound,
straight and consistent lines run from one into the other.
Capital is the first requisite of all human effort for goods
of any kind, and the increase of capital is therefore the
expansion of <em>chances</em> that intellectual, moral, and spiritual
good may be won. The moral question is: How will the
chances be used? If, then, the economic analysis shows
that protective taxes lessen capital, it follows that those
taxes lessen the regular chances for all higher good.</p>

<p id="sec_137">137. It is argued that hardship disciplines a man and
is good for him; hence, that the free traders, who want
people to do what is easiest, would corrupt them, and that
protectionists, by “making work,” bring in salutary discipline
for the people. This is the effect upon those who
pay the taxes. The counter-operation on the beneficiaries
of the system I have never seen developed. Bastiat said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
that the model at which the protectionist was aiming was
Sisyphus, who was condemned in Hades to roll a stone to
the top of a hill, from which, as soon as he got it there, it
rolled down again to the bottom. Then he rolled it up
again, and so on to all eternity. Here then was infinity of
effort, zero of result; the ultimate type to which the protectionist
system would come. Somebody pitied Sisyphus,
to whom he replied: “Thou fool! I enjoy everlasting
hope!” If Sisyphus could extract moral consolation from
his case, I am not prepared to deny but that a New England
farmer, ground between the upper millstone of free
competition, in his production, with the Mississippi Valley,
and the nether millstone of protective taxes on all his consumption,
may derive some moral consolation from his
case. There are a great many people who are apparently
ready to inflict salutary chastisement on the American
citizen for his welfare—and their own advantage.</p>

<p id="sec_138">138. The protectionist doctrine is that <em>if my earnings are
taken from me and given to my neighbor, and he spends them on
himself, there will be important moral gains to the community
which will be lost if I keep my own earnings, and spend them
on myself</em>. The facts of experience are all to the contrary.
When a man keeps his own earnings he is frugal, temperate,
prudent, and honest. When he gets and lives on
another man’s earnings, he is extravagant, wasteful, luxurious,
idle, and covetous. The effects on the community
in either case correspond.</p>

<p id="sec_139">139. The truth is that protectionism demoralizes and
miseducates a people (§§ <a href="#sec_89">89</a>, <a href="#sec_153">153</a>, <a href="#sec_155">155</a>). It deprives them
of individual self-reliance and energy, and teaches them
to seek crafty and unjust advantages. It breaks down the
skill of great merchants and captains of industry, and develops
the skill of lobbyists. It gives faith in monopoly,
combinations, jobbery, and restriction, instead of giving
faith in energy, free enterprise, public purity, and freedom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
Illustrations of this occur all the time. Objection has been
made to the introduction of machines to stop the smoke
nuisance because they would interfere in the competition
of anthracite and bituminous coal. People have resisted
the execution of ordinances against gambling houses because
said houses “make trade” for their neighbors. The
theater men recently made an attempt to get regulations
adopted against skating rinks—purely on moral grounds.
The industries of the country all run to the form of combinations.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
Our wisdom is developed, not in the great art
of production, but in the tactics of managing a combination,
and while we sustain all the causes and all the great principles
of this system of business we denounce “monopoly”
and “corporations.”</p>

<h4 class="hang">(<i>S</i>) <span class="smcap">That a “Worker may Gain More by Having his
Industry Protected than he will Lose by Having
to Pay Dearly for what he Consumes. A System
which Raises Prices all round—like that in the
United States at present—is Oppressive to Consumers,
but is Most Disadvantageous to those who
Consume without Producing anything, and Does
Little, if Any, Injury to those who Produce More
than they Consume.”</span></h4>

<p id="sec_140">140. This is an English contribution to the subject
dropped in passing by a writer on economic history.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> It
is a noteworthy fact that the “historical economists” and
others who deride political economy as a science do not
desist from it, but at once set to work to make very bad
political economy of the “abstract” or “deductive” sort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
The passage quoted involves three or four fallacies already
noticed, and an assumption of the truth of protectionism
as a philosophy. As we have abundantly established,
“workers” gain nothing by protection in their production
(§ <a href="#sec_48">48</a>). Also, “a system which raises prices all around”
must either lessen the demand and requirement for money,
<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, restrict business and the supply of goods (§ <a href="#sec_112">112</a>), or
it must increase the amount of money. In the former case
it could not but injure “workers”; in the latter case we
should find ourselves dealing with a greenback fallacy.
But passing by that, who are they who consume more than
they produce? I can think only of (1) princes, pensioners,
sinecurists, protected persons, and paupers, who draw support
from taxes, and (2) swindlers, confidence men, and
others who live by their wits on the produce of others.
Those under (1), if they receive fixed money grants or subsidies,
find an advance in price most disadvantageous. So
the protected, of course, as consumers of others’ products,
when they spend what they have received by protection,
suffer. Who are they who produce more than they consume?
I can think only of (1) taxpayers, and (2) victims
of fraud and of those economic errors which give one man’s
earnings to another’s use. Rise in price is just as advantageous
to this class as it was disadvantageous to the other,
on the same hypothesis, <abbr>viz</abbr>., if they pay fixed money taxes
to the parasites, and can sell their products for more money.
Evidently the writer did not understand correctly what his
two classes consisted of, and he put the protected “workers”
in the wrong one. If in industry a person should produce
more than he consumes, he could give it away, or it would
decay on his hands. If he should consume more than he
produced, he would run in debt and become bankrupt.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
Protection has nothing to do with that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">(<i>T</i>) That “A Duty may at once Protect the Native
Manufacturer Adequately, and Recoup the Country
for the Expense of Protecting him.”</span></h4>

<p id="sec_141">141. This is Professor Sidgwick’s doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> It has given
great comfort to our protectionists because it is put forward
by an Englishman and a Cambridge professor. It is
offered under the “art” of political economy. It is a new
thing; an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> art. The “may” in it deprives it of
the character of a doctrine or dogma such as our less cultivated
protectionists give us—“Protective taxes come out
of the foreigner”—but it is not a maxim of art. It has the
air of a very astute contrivance (see § <a href="#sec_3">3</a>), and is therefore
very captivating to many people, and it is very difficult
to dissect and to expose in a simple and popular way. It
has therefore given great trouble and done great mischief.
It is, however, a complete error. It is not possible in any
way or in any degree to use duties so as to make the foreigner
pay for protection.</p>

<p id="sec_142">142. Professor Sidgwick states the hypothetical instance
which he sets up to prove by illustration that there “may”
be such a case, as follows: “Suppose that a five per cent
duty is imposed on foreign silks, and that, in consequence,
after a certain interval, half the silks consumed are the product
of native industry, and that the price of the whole has
risen 2½ per cent. It is obvious that, under these circumstances,
the other half, which comes from abroad, yields
the state five per cent, while the tax levied from the consumers
on the whole is only 2½ per cent; so that the nation,
in the aggregate, is at this time losing nothing by protection,
except the cost of collecting the tax, while a loss
equivalent to the whole tax falls on the foreign producer.”</p>

<p id="sec_143">143. It is necessary, in the first place, to complete the
hypothesis which is included in this case. Let us assume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
that the consumption of silk, when all was imported, was
100 yards and that the price was $1 per yard. Then the
following points are taken for granted, although not stated
in the case as it is put: (1) That the state needs $5 revenue;
(2) that it has determined to get this out of <em>the consumers
of silk</em>; (3) that the advance in price does not diminish the
consumption; (4) that the tax forces a reduction of price
for the silk in the whole outside market; (5) that the
“<em>silk</em>” in question is the same thing after the tax is laid
as before. Of these assumptions, 3, 4, and 5 are totally
inadmissible, but, if they be admitted in the first instance,
and if the doctrine of the case which is put be deduced, it
is this: If the part imported multiplied by the tax is equal
to the total consumption multiplied by the advance in
price, the consumers can pay the latter in protection, for
it is equal to the former, and the former, which is paid to
the government by the foreigner, is what the consumers
of silk must otherwise have paid.</p>

<p id="sec_144">144. Obviously this deduction is arithmetically incorrect,
even on the hypothesis. In the first place, the government
has not obtained $5 revenue which it needed, but
$2.50 (5 cents on 50 yards). In the second place, the
foreigner sells at $1.02½ (net 97½) the silk which he used to
sell for $1. He therefore gets back from the consumers
2½ cents per yard on 50 yards, or $1.25 out of the $2.50
which he has paid to the government. Also, the domestic
silk to compete must be equal to the dollar imported silk
which now sells for $1.02½. Hence, the consumers really
pay in protection only 2½ cents on 50 yards, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> $1.25.
This case, then, is, that the foreigner pays $1.25 revenue,
and the consumers pay $1.25 revenue and $1.25 protection.
Hence the result is not at all what is asserted, and
there is no such operation of the contrivance as was expected.
But the government needs $2.50 more revenue,
the operation of its tax having been interfered with by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
protection. As there is no equivalence or compensation
in the case as it already stands, it is evident that the effect
of any further tax, instead of bringing about equivalence
or compensation, will be to depart from such a result still
further.</p>

<p id="sec_145">145. It is, however, impossible to admit assumptions
3, 4, and 5 above, or to deal with any economic problem
by any arithmetical process. The result above reached is
totally incorrect and only serves to clear the ground for a
correct analysis. The producer may have to bear part of
a tax, if he is under the tax jurisdiction, or if he has a monopoly.
If he has no monopoly, and is not under the tax jurisdiction,
and works for the world’s market, he cannot lower
his price in order to assume part of the tax. What he does
is that he differentiates his commodity. This is the fact
in the art of production which is established by abundant
experience. It is the explanation of the constant complaint,
under the protective system, of “fraud” and of
the constant demand for subclassification in the tariff
schedules. The protected product never is, at least at
first, as good in quality as the imported article which it
aims to supersede. Hence the foreigner, if he desires to
retain the protected market, can prepare a special quality
for that market. The “silk” after the tax is laid is not
the same silk as before. It nets to the foreign producer
97½ cents, and pays him business profits at that price.
Therefore when he sells it at $1.02½ he gets back the whole
tax from the consumers. The domestic silk sold at $1.02½
is no better than might have been obtained for 97½ cents.
Hence the consumers are paying a tax for protection which
is full and equal to the revenue rate. The fact that the
price has fallen to $1.02½, and is not $1.05, evidently proves
that instead of disproving it, as many believe.</p>

<p id="sec_146">146. Thus this case falls to pieces. It gains a momentary
plausibility from the erroneous assumptions which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
are implicit in it. The foreign producer may suffer a narrowing
of his market and a reduction of his aggregate profits,
but there is no way to make him tributary (unless he
has a monopoly) either to the treasury or the protected
interests of the taxing country.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> If it was true in general,
or in any limited number of cases, that a country which
lays protective taxes can make foreigners pay those taxes,
then England, which has had no protective taxes since
(say) 1850, and has been surrounded by countries which
have had more or less protective taxes, must have been
paying tribute to them all this time and must have been
steadily impoverished accordingly.</p>

<h3>Chapter V<br />

<span class="subhead">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION</span></h3>

<p id="sec_147">147. I have now examined protectionism impartially on
its own grounds, assuming them to be true, and adversely
from ground taken against it, and have reviewed a series
of the commonest arguments put forward in its favor. If
now we return, with all the light we have obtained, to test
the assumptions which we found in protectionism, that the
people would not organize their industry wisely under
liberty, and that protective taxes are the correct device for
bringing about a better organization, we find that those
two assumptions are totally false and have no semblance
of claim upon our confidence. At every step the dogmas
of protectionism, its claims, its apparatus, have proved
fallacious, absurd, and impracticable. We can now group
together some general criticisms of protectionism which
our investigation suggests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p id="sec_148">148. We have taken the protectionist’s own definition
of a protective duty, and have found that such a duty,
instead of increasing national wealth, must, at every step,
and by every incident of its operation, waste labor and
capital, lower the efficiency of the national industry, weaken
the country in trade, and consequently lower the standard
of comfort of the whole population. We have found that
protected industries, according to the statement of the
protectionists, do not produce, but consume. If then these
industries are <em>the</em> ones which make us rich, <em>consumption is
production and destruction produces</em>. The object of a protective
duty is “to effect the diversion of a part of the
capital and labor of the people out of the channels in which
it would run otherwise, into channels favored or created
by law” (§ <a href="#sec_13">13</a>). We have seen that the channels <em>into</em> which
the labor and capital of the people are to be diverted are
offered by <em>the industries which do not pay</em>. Hence protectionism
is found to mean that national prosperity is to be
produced by forcing labor and capital into employments
where the capital cannot be reproduced with the same
increase which could be won by it elsewhere. If that is
so, then capital in those employments will be wasted, and
the final outcome of our investigation, which must be made
the primary maxim of the art of national prosperity under
protectionism, is that <em>Waste makes Wealth</em>. Such is its
outcome when regarded as an economic philosophy.</p>

<p id="sec_149">149. As regards the social and jural relations which are
established between citizen and citizen, protectionism is
proved by a half-dozen independent analyses of it to be
simply a device for forcing us to levy tribute on each other.
If the law brings a cent to A it must have taken it from B,
or else it must have produced it out of nothing, that is, it
must be magic. Every soul pays protective taxes. If,
then, anybody gets anything from them, he needs to remember
what they cost him, and <em>he should insist on casting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
up both sides of the account</em>. If anybody gets nothing from
them, then <em>he pays the taxes and gets no equivalent</em>.</p>

<p id="sec_150">150. During the anti-corn-law campaign in England, a
writer in the <cite>Westminster Review</cite> illustrated protectionism
by the story of the monkeys in a cage, each of whom received
for his dinner a piece of bread. Each monkey
dropped his own piece of bread and grabbed his neighbor’s.
The consequence was that soon the floor of the cage was
strewn with fragments, and each monkey had to make the
best dinner he could from these. It is a good and fair illustration.
I saw a story recently in a protectionist newspaper
about the peasants in the Soudan. Each owns pigeons,
and at evening, when the pigeons come home, each tries
to entice as many of his neighbors’ pigeons as he can into
his own pigeon house. “All of them do the same thing,
and therefore each gets caught in his turn. They know this
perfectly well, but no Egyptian fellah could resist the temptation
of cheating his neighbor.” They ought to <em>tax</em> each
other’s pigeons all around. Then they would put themselves
at once on the level of free and enlightened Americans.
The protectionist assures me that it is for the good
of the community and for my good that he should tax me.
I reply that, in his language, “these are fine theories,” but
that whether it is good for the community or not, and
whether it is good for me or not, that he should tax me, I
can see that it is for his good that he should tax me. Then
he says: “Now you are abusive.”</p>

<p id="sec_151">151. <em>If protectionism is anything else than mutual tribute,
then it is magic.</em> The whole philosophy of it comes down to
questions like this: How much can I afford to pay a man
for hiring me? How much can I afford to pay a man for
trading with me? How much can I afford to pay a man to
cease to compete with me in my production? How much
can I afford to pay a man to go and compete with those who
supply me my consumption? It is only <em>an expensive way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
get what we could get for nothing if it was worth having</em> (§ <a href="#sec_89">89</a>).
It is admitted that one man cannot lift himself by his boot
straps. Suppose that a thousand men stand in a ring and
each takes hold of the other’s boot straps reciprocally and
they all lift, can the whole group lift itself as a group?
That is what protection comes to just as soon as we have
drawn out into light the other side, the <em>cost side</em> of it. Whatever
we win on one side, we must pay for by at least equal
cost on another. The losses will all be distributed as net
pure injury to the community. The harm of protection lies
here. It is not measured by the tax. <em>It is measured by the
total crippling of the national industry.</em> We might as well
say that it would be a good thing to put snags in the rivers,
to fell trees across the roads, to dull all our tools, as to say
that unnecessary taxation could work a blessing. Men
have argued that to destroy machines was to do a beneficial
thing, and I have recently read an article in a Boston paper,
quoting a Massachusetts man who thinks that what we
need is another war in the United States. Such men may
believe that protective taxes work a blessing, but to those
who will see the truth, it is plain that, when the whole
effect of the protective system is distributed, it benefits
nobody. It is a dead weight and loss upon everybody,
and those who think that they win by it would be far better
off in a community where no such system existed, but where
each man earned what he could and kept what he earned.</p>

<p id="sec_152">152. There is a school of political science in this country
in whose deed of foundation it is provided that the professors
shall teach how “by suitable tariff legislation, a
nation may keep its productive industry alive, cheapen the
cost of commodities, and oblige foreigners to sell to it at
low prices, while contributing largely toward defraying the
expenses of the government.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Is not that a fine thing?
Those professors ought to likewise provide us a panacea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
the philosopher’s stone, a formula for squaring the circle,
and all the other desiderata of universal happiness. It
would be only a trifle for them. The only fear is that they
may write the secret which they are to teach in books, and
that other nations to whom we are “foreigners,” may
learn it. Then while Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Germans
work for us at low prices and pay our taxes, we shall
be forced to work for them at low prices and pay their
taxes, and the old somber misery will settle down upon the
world again the same as ever.</p>

<p id="sec_153">153. Some years ago we were told that protection was
necessary because we had a big debt to pay. Well, we have
paid the debt until we have reduced it from $78.25 per
head to $28.41 per head. We, the people, have also raised
our credit until the annual debt charge has been reduced
from $4.29 per head to 95 cents per head. Now it is necessary
to keep up the debt in order to keep up the taxes, and
protectionism is now most efficient in forcing wasteful and
corrupting expenditures to get rid of revenue, lest a surplus
should furnish an argument for reducing taxation. This
is right on the doctrine that waste makes wealth.</p>

<p id="sec_154">154. They tell us that protection has produced prosperity,
and when we ask them to account for hard times in
spite of the tariff, they say that hard times are caused by
the free traders who will not keep still. Therefore <em>the prosperity
produced by protection is so precarious that it can be
overthrown by only talking about free trade</em>. They denounce
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez-faire</i>, or “let alone,” but the only question is <em>when</em>
to let alone, <em>when</em> to keep still. They do not let the tariff
alone if they want to revise it to suit them, or want to
make it “equitable.” When they get it “equitable” they
will let it alone, but that insures agitation, and makes sure
that they will cause it, for an indefinite time to come. On
the other hand the victims of the tariff will not keep still.
Their time to “let alone” is when it is repealed. If the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
tariff did not hurt somebody somewhere it would not do
any good to anybody anywhere, and the victims will resist.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
Mr. Lincoln used to tell a story about hearing a noise in
the next room. He looked in and found Bob and Tad
scuffling. “What is the matter, boys?” said he. “It is
Tad,” replied Bob, “who is trying to get my knife.” “Oh,
let him have it, Bob,” said Mr. Lincoln, “just to keep him
quiet.” “No!” said Bob, “it is my knife and I need it to
keep me quiet.” Mr. Lincoln used the story to prove that
there is no foundation for peace save truth and justice.
Now, in this case, <em>the man whose earnings are being taken
from him needs them to keep him quiet</em>. Our fathers fought
for free soil, and if we are worthy to be their sons we shall
fight for free trade, which is the necessary complement of
free soil. If a man goes to Kansas to-day and raises corn
on “free soil,” how does he get the good of it, unless he can
exchange that corn for any product of the earth that he
chooses on the best terms that the arts and commerce of
to-day can give him?</p>

<p id="sec_155">155. The history of civil liberty is made up of campaigns
against abuses of taxation. Protectionism is the
great modern abuse of taxation; the abuse of taxation
which is adapted to a republican form of government.
<em>Protectionism is now corrupting our political institutions just
as slavery used to do</em>, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, it allies itself with every other
abuse which comes up. Most recently it has allied itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
with the silver coinage, and it is now responsible, in a great
measure, for that calamity. The silver coinage law would
have been repealed three years ago if the silver mining
interest had not served notice on the protectionists that
that was their share of protection, and the price of their
coöperation. The silver coinage is the chief cause of the
“hard times” of the last two or three years. In a well-ordered
state it is the function of government to repress
every selfish interest which arises and endeavors to encroach
upon the rights of others. The state thus maintains
justice. Under protectionism <em>the government gives a
license to certain interests to go out and encroach on others</em>.
It is an iniquity as to the victims of it, a delusion as to its
supposed beneficiaries, and a waste of the public wealth.
There is only one reasonable question now to be raised
about it, and that is: How can we most easily get rid of it?</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A year</span> and a half ago a gentleman who had just
been reëlected, by Republicans, to the Senate of the
United States, made a five-minute speech acknowledging
the honor. In respect to public affairs he uttered but one
opinion: that the people of the United States were confronted
by a most serious problem, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, how to reduce
taxation. On the face of it, this was a most extraordinary
statement, and the chronicler or historian might well take
note of it as a new event in the life of the human race.
Statesmen and historians are familiar enough with the
difficulty of raising more revenue, and laying more taxes,
but the solemn and calamitous position of a nation which
is forced to reduce its taxes, and finds itself confronted by
industrial disaster if it does it, is something new. Students
of political economy are familiar with the question: What
harm to industry may be done by levying taxes on it?
But the problem of how to avert the economic disaster
which may follow taking them off is new. Of course the
state of mind revealed by the formulation of the above
problem is the result of a long habit of regarding taxation
as an industrial force, or, at least, as an effective condition
of industrial success.</p>

<p>There is, however, a problem; in regard to that fact all
concur. It is also a rare problem, one for which the only
precedent is to be found in our own history, and when the
case occurred before, it proved to be fraught with calamity.
We are confronted by the dangers of a surplus revenue, and
no proposal to do away with the surplus in extravagant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
expenditures can stand before the common sense of the
people.</p>

<p>If the taxes are collecting more than the public necessities
require, then the simple and obvious, and, in fact, the
only solution, is not to collect the taxes; let the people
keep their own products and do what they please with
them. If we do not make a problem there will not be any;
if we simply do in the most straightforward manner what
the common sense of the situation demands, there will be
no difficulty; the consequences will all take care of themselves,
and all the imaginary calamities will fail to appear.
If, however, we must have a grand scheme of national
prosperity established in advance, then the case is different.</p>

<p>During the war a notion grew up here that, through some
new dispensation of fate, it was possible for the American
people to make war and prosper by it. After the war the
notion grew up that the paper money was a condition of
success and that we should be ruined if we resumed specie
payments. Now we are met by the doctrine that we cannot
repeal the taxes which were laid during the war, partly
in order to carry it on, because our national prosperity is
bound up in them. These notions, in fact, are all consistent,
and all hang together; they all belong to a philosophy that
men prosper by discord and war, not by peace and harmony.
According to that philosophy we touched unawares
the springs of prosperity when we engaged in a civil war,
incurred an immense debt, and laid crushing taxes. Now,
therefore, when we ask that the taxes which are no longer
necessary may be taken off, the men who have fallen under
the dominion of these fallacies tell us that it cannot be
done; that our prosperity would be undermined by it.
They have been assuring us for years past that the protective
system was sure to produce a solid and stable prosperity;
now, by their own statement, it has produced a state
of things so weak and unstable that it must be maintained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
by heavy taxes. The industrial prosperity of the United
States proves to be as burdensome to it as the armaments
of the European nations are to them.</p>

<p>The notion seems to be that protective taxes, laid on
imports, are the particular kind of taxes which make national
prosperity, and which therefore ought not to be
touched. It is proposed that internal taxes shall be reduced.
If local taxes on real estate, etc., are reduced,
every one rejoices; that is supposed to be a clear and
simple gain. I have known the same man to exert himself
very actively to scrutinize local expenditures, and
reduce local taxes, and to boil with rage against free traders
who want to reduce protective taxes. However, there is
probably no tax of any kind whatsoever which does not interfere
with the conditions of supply and demand, or industrial
competition, in such a way as to give “protection”
to somebody at the expense of somebody else. There are
persons who are now enjoying great advantages in their
business from the whisky and tobacco taxes which they
would lose if those taxes were repealed. This is one of the
incidental mischiefs of all taxation and one of the reasons
for insisting that taxation shall be as slight as possible, and,
to that end, that government functions shall be limited as
much as possible.</p>

<p>We are, therefore, face to face with the question whether
we are able to reduce our own taxes, and whether we are
free to do so. We may fairly ask: if not, why not? It is
plain that this is a question of domestic policy and of our
own interest altogether. All the attempts to prejudice it
by talking about “England” are impertinent, and all allegations
that those of us who want to reduce our own taxes
are trying “to give away our market,” etc., belong to the
worst abuses of political discussion. What is true is that
we have built up a vast combination of vested interests,
which in a few cases have, and in nearly all cases think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
they have, an interest in maintaining the taxes. These are
among ourselves; what they gain, they gain from us; it
is with them that we have to contend. They have thus
far carried on the fight by all the methods dear to vested
interests; they have put forth plausible fallacies, sought
alliances, procured delays, appealed to prejudices.</p>

<p>Behind these selfish and sordid interests, however, there
is the strong and sincere prejudice which still prevails
among the civilized nations of to-day, and which is dividing
them into hostile parties, carrying on tariff wars with
each other. I call it “protectionism,” because it is not
a policy, but a philosophy of national welfare. In the
United States it takes the form of various fallacies about
the home markets, diversification of industry, wages, etc.
As these are all questions of political economy, and as all
who talk on the subject at all are talking political economy
of some sort or other, it seems that a great work of education
is to be done here on the field of economic doctrine.
Hitherto the attempt of the politicians has been not to perform
this work of education but to thrust it aside.</p>

<p>As soon as the issue is formed, however, and the protectionists
are forced to formulate their doctrine, as a doctrine,
its absurdity becomes apparent. It is not capable of
statement. If we are to have temporary protection, in
order to start infant industries, then it will become imperatively
necessary, so soon as public attention is occupied
by the subject, to say how, and how far, and how long,
the system is to be kept up, and the public will demand to
know how it is getting on, and at what rate it is approaching
its goal. For this reason those who have any logical
directness of thinking, have already advanced to a more
intense position; they advocate protectionism as a permanent
and universal economic philosophy. In that form
it flies in the face of common sense and civilization; in
some of the latest forms which it has taken on in the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
of some professors of political economy, it is a kind of
economic mysticism.</p>

<p>If, however, the United States could be cut off from all
the rest of the world as regards trade and industry, then
at least it should be plain that whatever material prosperity
they could gain would be just what they, with their
energy, enterprise, and capital, are able to extract from
such soil and climate as nature has given to us here. What
would be the difference if, then, there were no tax barriers?
Certainly none whatever. The wealth which the American
people get they must produce by applying their labor and
capital to the natural advantages which they possess.
With foreign trade open to them, they will not make use of
it unless they find an advantage in it; that is, unless American
labor and capital can attain more wealth through exchange
than without it. The task of American producers
will still be to attain the greatest possible wealth by expending
their labor and capital on American soil, either directly,
or with an intermediate step of exchange. Wages are only
a part of the product of the country; if then, trade increased
the amount of commodities at the disposition of the people,
it would increase the amount of each share in the distribution.
This is the simplest common sense of the matter,
stripped of all technicalities, and to this the whole discussion
must again and again return.</p>

<p>If now we begin to reduce and abolish the taxes which
were laid during the war, we shall simply begin to free the
American people from a clog on their energies and a waste
of their industrial strength. Every step in this direction
is an emancipation under which we may be sure that the
national energy which is set free will spring up with the
quickest response. The guarantee of this is in the character
of the people, and in the natural advantages which they possess.
Whatever chances we have, we have in the nature of
the case; the tariff could not give us any; it could only divert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
in one way or another those which nature has given us.
This diversion or perversion has now entered into the experience
and education of our generation. We have no
idea of the welfare we should enjoy if we were only free to
use the chances which are within our reach, and a great
many of us have spun out a kind of political economy to
prove that the cords which bind us are the tools by which
we work.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHAT_IS_FREE_TRADE33">WHAT IS FREE TRADE?<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor smaller">33</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> never would have been any such thing to fight
for as free speech, free press, free worship, or free
soil, if nobody had ever put restraints on men in those matters.
We never should have heard of free trade, if no restrictions
had ever been put on trade. If there had been
any restrictions on the intercourse between the states of
this Union, we should have heard of ceaseless agitation to
get those restrictions removed. Since there are no restrictions
allowed under the Constitution, we do not realize the
fact that we are enjoying the blessings of complete liberty,
where, if wise counsels had not prevailed at a critical moment,
we should now have had a great mass of traditional
and deep-rooted interferences to encounter.</p>

<p>Our intercourse with foreign nations, however, has been
interfered with, because it is a fact that, by such interference,
some of us can win advantages over others. The
power of Congress to levy taxes is employed to lay duties
on imports, not in order to secure a revenue from imports,
but to prevent imports—in which case, of course, no revenue
will be obtained. The effect which is aimed at, and which
is attained by this device, is that the American consumer,
when he wants to satisfy his needs, has to go to an American
producer of the thing he wants, and has to give to him
a price for the product which is greater than that which some
foreigner would have charged. The object of this device,
as stated on the best protectionist authority, is: “To effect
the diversion of a part of the labor and capital of the people
out of the channels in which it would run otherwise, into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
channels favored or created by law.” This description is
strictly correct, and from it the reader will see that protection
has nothing to do with any foreigner whatever. It is
purely a question of domestic policy. It is only a question
whether we shall, by taxing each other, drive the industry
of this country into an arbitrary and artificial development,
or whether we shall allow one another to employ each his
capital and labor in his own way. Note that there is for us
all the same labor, capital, soil, national character, climate,
etc.,—that is, that all the conditions of production remain
unaltered. The only change which is operated is a wrenching
of labor and capital out of the lines on which they would
act under the impulse of individual enterprise, energy, and
interest, and their impulsion in another direction selected
by the legislator. Plainly, all the import duty can do is
to close the door, shutting the foreigner out and the Americans
in. Then, when an American needs iron, coal, copper,
woolens, cottons, or anything else in the shape of manufactured
commodities, the operation begins. He has to
buy in a market which is either wholly or partially monopolized.
The whole object of shutting him in is to take advantage
of this situation to make him give more of his
products for a given amount of the protected articles, than
he need have given for the same things in the world’s market.
Under this system a part of our product is diverted
from the satisfaction of our needs, and is spent to hire
some of our fellow-citizens to go out of an employment
which would pay under the world’s competition, into one
which will not pay under the world’s competition. We,
therefore, do with less clothes, furniture, tools, crockery,
glassware, bed and table linen, books, etc., and the satisfaction
we have for this sacrifice is knowing that some of
our neighbors are carrying on business which according to
their statement does not pay, and that we are paying their
losses and hiring them to keep on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>Free trade is a revolt against this device. It is not a
revolt against import duties or indirect taxes as a means of
raising revenue. It has nothing to say about that, one way
or the other. It begins to protest and agitate just as soon
as any tax begins to act protectively, and it denounces any
tax which one citizen levies on another. The protectionists
have a long string of notions and doctrines which they put
forward to try to prove that their device is not a contrivance
by which they can make their fellow-citizens contribute
to their support, but is a device for increasing
the national wealth and power. These allegations must be
examined by economists, or other persons who are properly
trained to test their correctness, in fact and logic. It is
enough here to say, over a responsible signature, that no
such allegation has ever been made which would bear examination.
On the contrary, all such assertions have the
character of apologies or special pleas to divert attention
from the one plain fact that the advocates of a protective
tariff have a direct pecuniary interest in it, and that
they have secured it, and now maintain it, for that reason
and no other. The rest is all afterthought and excuse. If
any gain could possibly come to the country through
the gains of the beneficiaries of the tariff, obviously the
country must incur at least an equal loss through the
losses of that part of the people who pay what the protected
win. If a country could win anything that way, it
would be like a man lifting himself by his boot straps.</p>

<p>The protectionists, in advocating their system, always
spend a great deal of effort and eloquence on appeals to
patriotism, and to international jealousies. These are all
entirely aside from the point. The protective system is a
domestic system, for domestic purposes, and it is sought
by domestic means. The one who pays, and the one who
gets, are both Americans. The victim and the beneficiary
are amongst ourselves. It is just as unpatriotic to oppress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
one American as it is patriotic to favor another. If we
make one American pay taxes to another American, it will
neither vex nor please any foreign nation.</p>

<p>The protectionists speak of trade with the contempt of
feudal nobles, but on examination it appears that they
have something to sell, and that they mean to denounce
trade with their rivals. They denounce cheapness, and
it appears that they do so because they want to sell dear.
When they buy, they buy as cheaply as they can. They
say that they want to raise wages, but they never pay
anything but the lowest market rate. They denounce
selfishness, while pursuing a scheme for their own selfish
aggrandizement, and they bewail the dominion of self-interest
over men who want to enjoy their own earnings,
and object to surrendering the same to them. They
attribute to government, or to “the state,” the power
and right to decide what industrial enterprises each of us
shall subscribe to support.</p>

<p>Free trade means antagonism to this whole policy and
theory at every point. The free trader regards it as all
false, meretricious, and delusive. He considers it an invasion
of private rights. In the best case, if all that the
protectionist claims were true, he would be taking it upon
himself to decide how his neighbor should spend his earnings,
and—more than that—that his neighbor shall spend
his earnings for the advantage of the men who make the
decision. This is plainly immoral and corrupting; nothing
could be more so. The free trader also denies that the
government either can, or ought to regulate the way in
which a man shall employ his earnings. He sees that the
government is nothing but a clique of the parties in interest.
It is a few men who have control of the civic organization.
If they were called upon to regulate business, they would
need a wisdom which they have not. They do not do this.
They only turn the “channels” to the advantage of themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
and their friends. This corrupts the institutions of
government and continues under our system all the old
abuses by which the men who could get control of the
governmental machinery have used it to aggrandize themselves
at the expense of others. The free trader holds
that the people will employ their labor and capital to the
best advantage when each man employs his own in his own
way, according to the maxim that “A fool is wiser in his
own house than a sage in another man’s house”;—how
much more, then, shall he be wiser than a politician? And
he holds, further, that by the nature of the case, if any
governmental coercion is necessary to drive industry in
a direction in which it would not otherwise go, such coercion
must be mischievous.</p>

<p>The free trader further holds that protection is all a mistake
and delusion to those who think that they win by it,
in that it lessens their self-reliance and energy and exposes
their business to vicissitudes which, not being incident to a
natural order of things, cannot be foreseen and guarded
against by business skill; also that it throws the business
into a condition in which it is exposed to a series of heats
and chills, and finally, unless a new stimulus is applied, reduced
to a state of dull decay. They therefore hold that
even the protected would be far better off without it.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I think</span> it must be now nearly twenty years since I
have made a free-trade speech or been able to take
share in a free-trade dinner.</p>

<p>When I was invited here this evening I thought I would
try to come for the pleasure of hearing the gentlemen,
especially the members of Congress, who were announced
to speak here. I have been so out of health that it has been
impossible for me to sit up evenings or to attempt public
speaking in the evenings, but things are going a little better
and I will make an attempt to say a little—not very
much, as the hour is now late.</p>

<p>Thirty-five or forty years ago I became a free trader for
two great reasons, as far as I can now remember.</p>

<p>One was because, as a student of political economy, my
whole mind revolted against the notion of magic that is
involved in the notion of a protective tariff. That is, there
are facts that are accounted for by protectionism through
assertions that are either plainly untrue or are entirely
irrational. The other reason was because it seemed to
me that the protective tariff system nourished erroneous
ideas of success in business and produced immoral results
in the minds and hopes of the people.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I have got any more light on the matter
within the last twenty years; it looks to me still as
if the great objections to protectionism were these two. No
man who enjoys the benefit of a protective tariff, as he
believes, can ever tell whether he gets back anything for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
the taxes which he pays or not. He never has any analysis
of the operation and never knows whether or not he really
recovers from the action of the tariff what he pays in.</p>

<p>I say now the taxes which he pays, because—let us not
make any mistake about this—the matter we are talking
about is one entirely of Americans and between Americans.
If the protective tariff operates so as to perform what is
attributed to it, it prevents things from being imported
into this country. That may be a disadvantage to the
foreigner, it may disappoint him in his hopes, but we may
leave him out of account. Then the increase of the cost of
these commodities for the American consumer at home is the
source from which the American protected manufacturer
must obtain his benefit, if he ever obtains any. Therefore
he has to pay also taxes to the other protected industries
on account of the operation of the system. Therefore he
is both paying and receiving, but whether or not he gets
back the part that he hoped to receive is a question which
he never can sift and never can know.</p>

<p>I should myself suppose that possibly the Pennsylvanian
on his coal and iron might stand a good chance of winning
something. The operation is direct and simple in that case,
and coal and iron are to-day the very first conditions of
industry. They must be obtained as raw material, because
they enter into everything, and it is possible that
under those circumstances the game might be sufficiently
direct so that its effect could be felt and perceived. But
the Connecticut manufacturer has to pay taxes on coal and
iron and copper and the other metals, and he has to pay also
the taxes on wool and the other raw materials, and then
comes the question whether he ever gets it back again or
not. He never knows; he cannot know; he cannot feel
it and he cannot possibly know whether the operation of
the system is to bring him back a return for his outlay or
not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>We hear a great deal about a rightly adjusted tariff. It
is a constant ideal that is presented, whenever the tariff
subject comes up again for discussion in Congress, that it
ought to be rightly adjusted, and when it is, it is going to
perform its beneficial operation.</p>

<p>How can a tariff ever be rightly adjusted unless the industry
will stand still? The taxes stand still for years without
change. The industries never stand still. There are
new inventions in machinery, there are new raw materials
brought into use, there are new processes developed, and
all that changes the character of the industry. These inventions
and improvements and processes are all ignored
by the protective system. It contains no allowance for
them at all. But our people are full of enterprise, they are
fond of improvements, they like novelties, and they adopt
changes. The consequence is that the industry changes,
and then again the decisions that are made by somebody
or other as to the doubtful questions in the interpretation
of the law are also constantly changing, and then by and
by we find a lot of people who want the tariff changed.
They say it needs to be adapted to the time, it is out of
date, it has fallen behind, it does not fit the requirements
of the moment, and they would like to have a tariff revision;
but they are told then that they ought to keep
still and not make a disturbance which will bring up a discussion
of the entire tariff system, and that they ought to
allow it to go on for the sake of the “system.”</p>

<p>What is the system then? The system means that the
import duties that we have in this country have raised the
prices of all commodities in our market, I may say thirty
or forty per cent on a very low calculation. Is not that a
very extraordinary thing when you stand off and try
to realize it for a minute—that we have raised the prices
in the United States thirty or forty per cent—perhaps
more nearly fifty per cent—above the level of the prices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
for the same commodities in the other civilized countries
of our grade; and that we believe that we have done a grand
and noble thing by raising these prices, putting the whole
level of life in this country on an artificial plane that much
above the level of the world’s market? In fact, if you
should listen to a protectionist he would make you believe
that this continent would not be habitable if it was not for
the protective tariff that is here working this operation all
the time on the American market.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion—I am not very confident about it—but
it looks to me as if it were true that a protective tariff
wears out in a little while—I mean, so far as its expected
beneficial effect is concerned. Its effects are distributed,
they are taken up and they are allowed for all around the
market until the expected benefit to the protected people is
lost and there remains nothing but the dead weight of the
system itself as an interference with the industries. There
is then a call for a new tariff in order to get another impulse
or another fillip, as I have heard it called, to give
things a new impulse, to start them on again.</p>

<p>That has been the history of our tariff now for one hundred
years, that it has been restarted, reinvigorated from
time to time in order to give a new impulse. Then in the
very nature of the case, therefore, it seems to me that a
new impulse is constantly required.</p>

<p>As I said at the outset, the tariff system seems to me to
teach us to believe that a man needs a “pull” of some
kind or other to make any industry a success. It is an
idea that there must always be a provision of easy profit
in connection with the industry that shall demand no labor
or no expenditure of capital to get it. That is the pure doctrine
of graft. The tariff teaches us to look for a fee or a
gratuity or a rake-off which will be a pure and net profit.
People are told that tariff taxes are a rightful gift to the
beneficiary. Those who do not get that gain seek another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
one of the same kind somewhere, and when they do that
they have recourse to graft.</p>

<p>It is a shameful fact that this notion of graft, and this
word, should have come to us, as it has within the last four
or five years, and should have extended so far and become
so familiar to us in connection with a great many of the
operations of business. It is customary, as we have known
for a long time, in some nations, for instance in Russia,
China, and Turkey; and with us it has seemed to spread and
win acceptance and currency in a most astonishing manner.
I cannot believe but what the tariff system has educated
us in this direction and prepared us to tolerate and accept
the development of this idea. It also seems to me that
now, after one hundred years of this system, the tariff is
no longer properly an economic question. It is a practical
political question. The politics and the business are interwoven
in it inextricably. There is no economic discussion
possible of the propositions that are made, economic in
form, in connection with the tariff system. There is only
a war of partial views and of superficial inferences.</p>

<p>Our American protectionism has grown out of the peculiar
circumstances of this country. It is an old idea that
has come down to us from Europe, and, indeed, from the
Middle Ages in Europe, and here it found a chance for a
new and very remarkable development. There were new
conditions here, and the chances were so big and grand
that, as a matter of fact, the protective system has never
done more than exact a certain tribute from us on these
chances. It has never really touched us in an acute and
sensible way, and in spite of it we have enjoyed marvelous
prosperity which is due really to the circumstances of advantage
and favor which we have enjoyed here.</p>

<p>In the year 1892 we got an issue on this matter and went
to the electorate with it, with the result that we all know.
But the mandate of the people was neglected and disobeyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
by the government and the purpose that the people showed
at that time was defied.</p>

<p>We have also had opportunity to notice the great power
of the protected interests in Congress. The fact is that we
are being governed at the present time by a combination
of these protected interests which have got control of the
machinery of government, and have control of the personnel
of the government to such an extent that it is almost
impossible, practically, to make any breach in this system
at all. That is because the political combinations have
been so thoroughly wrought out and so ingeniously developed
that they look at present as if they were impregnable.</p>

<p>I look around to see if I can find some encouragement.
I thought that it was something of an encouragement when
Mr. Dalzell made this speech in Congress that Mr. Williams
has referred to, in which he poured such scorn on the idea
of “incidental protection.” I have never said anything so
severe about any protectionist idea as that which he said
about incidental protection. But suppose that the people
of 1850, the middle of the nineteenth century, could come
to life again, the old protectionists of that time. What
would they think to hear a man speak with scorn of incidental
protection? It was what they believed in; it was
the whole business to them. When an old protectionist
like Mr. Dalzell can turn around and pour scorn upon
incidental protection I feel as if we never could tell what
they might throw overboard next time, in some paroxysm
of some kind or other, of fear or hope or something else,
and we might get a chance that we have not been able
to get in the past.</p>

<p>Then, as has been well said by other gentlemen to-night,
there has been within the last year or two a very great
revolt in the public mind against graft and political and
business corruption. How far will this go? We do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
know, but it is, at any rate, an opening in the public mind
that is full of chances. It may go very far; it may have
very great effects; it is certainly something to be noticed
and taken advantage of.</p>

<p>Then, again, there are new conflicts of interests arising.
We have become very great people in the world’s commerce,
with a billion dollars’ worth of exports and imports
in a year, and we are so interwoven with the whole world
that it will not be possible for us to go on with our old
policy of discouraging commerce and rejecting it, and trying
to stop it, and paying no attention at all to the remonstrances
of our neighbors. In future we shall be obliged
to pay some attention to these remonstrances. They are
just, they are reasonable, and they will command our attention;
and then we shall have to make concessions to
them. In other words, we cannot any longer afford to
reject and neglect these remonstrances.</p>

<p>It may be, therefore, that in the time that is now before
us we shall have better chances for a practical war upon
this system than we have had hitherto. As long, however,
as I can remember, and as long as I have had any share in
it, we have got along without any encouragement in it at
all. We have done what we could without that. We got
so we did not expect it. We knew that we should be
neglected and treated as persons whose opinions in these
matters were not of any importance or worthy of any attention,
and so we went on and kept up our arguments, as we
considered them, to the best of our ability and without
very much result.</p>

<p>Now, it may be that we are on the eve of a different
time, when the circumstances will be more favorable, more
hopeful, more full of opportunities, and I certainly, for
my part, most profoundly hope that that is so.</p>

<p>I have noticed with some discouragement the efforts
that Mr. Williams has made on the floor of Congress to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
some modifications of the tariff made, or some argument
even opened up there that might give the matter activity and
life in the legislative domain. They did not seem any more
encouraging than what we used to see in the old times.
But it is certainly in the nature of things that the difficulties
and absurdities of this system must come out in practice
more and more distinctly as we go on, and the need for
reform will therefore force itself in the shape of a play of
interests that will bring new and counteracting forces into
operation to which we may look for help in the overthrow
of the system.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PROSPERITY_STRANGLED_BY_GOLD35">PROSPERITY STRANGLED BY GOLD<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor smaller">35</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Some</span> of the silver fallacies were stated by Mr. St.
John, in his address before the silver convention, with
such precision that his speech offers a favorable opportunity
for dealing with them.</p>

<p>He says that “it is amongst the first principles in finance
that the value of each dollar, expressed in prices, depends
upon the total number of dollars in circulation.” There is
no such principle of finance as the one here formulated.
The “quantity doctrine” of currency is gravely abused by
all bimetallists, from the least to the greatest, and it is at
best open to great doubt. When the dollars in question
are dollars of some money of account which can circulate
beyond the territory of the State in which it is issued, the
quantity doctrine cannot be true within that territory. It
may be noted, in passing, that this is the reason why no
scheme of the silver people for manipulating prices in the
United States can possibly succeed. Silver and gold will be
exported and imported until their values conform throughout
the world, and prices fixed in one or the other of them
will conform to the world’s prices, after all the trouble
and waste and loss of translating them two or three times
over have been endured.</p>

<p>The quantity doctrine, however, means that the value of
the currency is a question of supply and demand, and
everybody knows that to double or halve the supply does
not halve or double the value, or have any other effect
which is simple and direct. If it did have such effect speculation
would not be what it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>Mr. St. John goes on to argue that our population increases
two millions every year, on account of which we
need more dollars; that the production of gold does not
furnish enough to meet this need, and that, therefore,
prices fall. This argumentation is very simple and very
glib. Prosperity and adversity are put into a syllogism of
three lines. But, if we can avert the fall in prices and adversity
by coining silver, it must be by adding the silver to
the gold which we now have. “High” and “low” prices
are only relative terms. They mean higher and lower than
at another time or place; higher and lower than we have
been used to. If misery depends on ten-cent corn we are
advised to cut the cents in two and we shall get twenty-cent
corn and prosperity. Corn will not be altered in value
in gold, or outside of the United States, and, as all other
things will be marked up at the same time and in the same
way, its value in other things will not be altered by this
operation. When we get used to twenty-cent corn it will
seem just as low and just as “hard for the debtor” as ten-cent
corn is now. Then we can divide by ten and get two-dollar
corn, by adding free coinage of copper. When we
get used to that we shall be no better satisfied with it. We
can then make paper dollars and coin them without limit.
Million-dollar corn will then become as bitter a subject for
complaint as ten-cent corn is now. The fact that people
are discontented is no argument for anything.</p>

<p>The fact that prices are low is made the subject of social
complaint and of political agitation in the United States.
Prices have undergone a wave since 1850. They arose until
about 1872. They have fallen again. They are lower than
they were at the top of the wave all the world over. This
fact, the explanation of which would furnish a very complicated
task for trained statisticians and economists, is
made a topic of easy interpretation and solution in political
conventions and popular harangues, and it is proposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
adopt violent and portentous measures upon the basis of
the flippant notions which are current about it. But what
difference does it make whether the “plane” of prices is
high or low? If corn is at forty cents a bushel and calico
at twenty cents a yard, a bushel buys two yards. If corn
is at ten cents a bushel and calico at five cents a yard, a
bushel will buy two yards. So of everything else. If, then,
there has been a <em>general</em> fall, and that is the alleged grievance,
neither farmers nor any other one class has suffered
by it.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that a period of advancing prices
stimulates energy and enterprise. It does so even when, if
all the facts were well known, it might be found that capital
was really being consumed in successive periods of production.
Falling prices discourage enterprise, although, if
all facts were known to the bottom, it might be found
that capital was being accumulated in successive periods
of production.</p>

<p>It is also true that a depreciation of the money of account,
<em>while it is going on</em>, stimulates exports and restrains
imports.</p>

<p>But who can tell how we are to make prices always go
up, unless by constant and unlimited inflation? Who can
tell how we are to avoid fluctuations in prices or eliminate
the element of contingency, risk, foresight, and speculation?</p>

<p>It is also true that, although high prices and low prices
are immaterial at any one time, the change from one to the
other, from one period of time to another, affects the burden
of outstanding time contracts. Men make contracts for
dollars, not for dollar’s-worths. Selling long or short is one
thing; lending is another. Borrowers and lenders never
guarantee each other the purchasing power of dollars at a
future time. If the contracts were thus complicated they
would become impossible. Between 1850 and 1872 the
debtors made no complaint and the creditors never thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
of getting up an agitation to have debts scaled up. The
debtors now are demanding that they be allowed to play
heads I win, tails you lose, and Mr. St. John and others
tell us that they have the votes to carry it; as if that made
any difference in the forum of discussion.</p>

<p>Increase in population does not prove an increased need
of money. It may prove the contrary. If the population
becomes more dense over a given area, a higher organization
may make less money necessary. If railroads and
other means of communication are extended, money is
economized. If banks and other credit institutions are
multiplied, and if credit operations are facilitated by public
security, good administration of law, etc., less money is
needed. If these changes are going on at the same time
that population is increasing (and such is undoubtedly
the case in the United States), who can tell whether the
net result is to make more or less currency necessary?
Nobody; and all assertions about the matter are wild and
irresponsible.</p>

<p>If it was true that an increase of two millions in the
population called for more dollars, how does anybody know
whether the current gold production is adequate to meet
the new requirement or not? The assertion is arithmetical.
It says that two quantities are not equal to each
other. The first quantity is the increase in the currency
called for by two million more people. How much more is
needed? Nobody knows, and there is no way to find out.
The silver men have put figures for it from time to time,
but the figures rested on nothing and were mere bald assertions.
The second quantity is the amount of new gold
annually available for coinage in the United States. How
much is this? Nobody knows, because if an attempt is
made to define what is meant it is found that there is no idea
in the words. The people of the United States buy and
coin just as much gold as they want at any time. Hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
two things are said to be unequal to each other, when nobody
knows how big either one of them is. It may be
added that it makes no difference how big either one of
them is. How much additional tin is needed annually for
the increase of our population? Do the mines produce it?
Nobody knows or asks. The mines produce, and the people
buy, what they want. The case is the same as to gold.</p>

<p>We find, then, that Mr. St. John begins with a doctrine
which is untenable; then he asserts a relation between
population and the need of money which does not exist;
then he assumes that this need is greater than the amount
of new gold produced, although neither he nor anybody else
knows how big either one of these quantities is. This is
the argumentation by which he aims to show that prices
are reduced and misery produced by the single gold standard.
It is the argumentation which is current among the
silver people. Not a step of it will bear examination. The
inference that we must restore the free coinage of silver, to
escape this strangulation of prosperity, falls to the ground.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is an essential part of the case of the silver men that
the country is having “hard times.” The bolters from
the Republican convention say, in their manifesto: “Discontent
and distress prevail to an extent never before known
in the history of the country.” This is an historical assertion.
It is distinctly untrue. There is no such discontent
and distress as there was in 1819, or in 1840, or in 1875, to
say nothing of other periods. The writers did not know
the facts of the history, and they made use of what is nowadays
a mere figure of speech. People who want to say
that a social phenomenon is big, and who do not know
what has been before, say that it is unparalleled in history.</p>

<p>There has been an advancing paralysis of enterprise and
arrest of credit ever since the Sherman act of 1890 was
passed. The bolters say that “No reason can be found for
such an unhappy condition of things save in a vicious monetary
system.” The reason for it has been that the cumulative
effect of the silver legislation was steadily advancing
to a crisis. The efforts by which the effects of that legislation
had been put off were no longer effective, and it was
evident that the country was on the verge of a cataclysm
in which the standard of value would be changed. What
man can fail to see the effect of such a fear on credit and
enterprise? And with such a fear in the market, how idle
it is to try to represent the trouble as caused by the fact
that the existing standard was of gold, or of silver, or of
anything else! Men will make contracts and go on with
business by the use of any medium, the terms of which can
be defined, understood, and maintained until the contract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
is solved, but uncertainty as to the terms, or danger of
change in them, makes credit and enterprise impossible. In
the whole history of finance no crisis can be found which
was so utterly unnecessary, and so distinctly caused by the
measures of policy which had gone before it, as that of 1893.</p>

<p>So much being admitted as to “hard times,” it remains
true, however, that by far the greatest part of the current
declamation about hard times is false. Prosperity and adversity
of society are not capable of exact verification. At
all times some people, classes, industries, are less prosperous
than others. The fashion has grown up among
politicians and stump orators of using assertions about
prosperity and distress as arguments for their purpose,
and parties come before the public with prosperity policies.
They have programs for “making the country prosperous.”
If this country, with its population, its resources,
and its chances, is not prosperous by the intelligence, industry,
and thrift of its population, does any sane man
suppose that politicians and stump orators have any devices
at their control for making it so? The orators of the
present day see prosperity where they need to see it for the
purposes of their argument. They say that all gold-standard
countries in Europe are in distress. Mr. St. John says
that Mexico is prosperous. As to Canada, we have seen no
statement. According to some discussions which are current,
the bicycle rivals the gold standard as a calamity-producer.
As the bicycle has certainly gravely affected the
distribution of expenditure and the accumulation of capital,
its efficiency as a crisis-maker, in its degree, whatever that
may be, can be rationally discerned, but nobody has ever
been able to show any rational grounds of belief that the
gold standard is a crisis-maker.</p>

<p>A crisis will also be produced whenever capital has been
invested on a large scale in any unproductive investment,
whereby it is not reproduced, but is lost. The enterprises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
are always made the basis of engagements and contracts.
When the enterprises fail, the engagements cannot be met;
other engagements based on these also fail, and so on
through the whole industrial organization. Such crises
are inevitable in a new country. Enterprises run in fashions.
At any one time great groups of producers tend to
one line of industry. That industry is sure to be overdone
and to come to a crisis. In a free country, where every
man is at liberty to direct his enterprise as he sees fit, what
is the sense, when it turns out that he has made a mistake,
of trying to throw the losses on other people? No one
would propose it as to an individual or a number, but when
there is a great interest it makes itself a political power and
produces a platform for the same purpose, generally with
inflated principles of humanity, justice, democracy, and
Americanism as wind-attachments to make it float.</p>

<p>Mr. St. John says that the farmers are spending ten
dollars an acre to get eight or nine dollars an acre. What
farmer in the United States can tell how many dollars
he spends on an acre? What is the sense of these pretendedly
accurate figures? But, if they had sense, what
would be the gain of cutting the dollars in two? If the
farmer spent twenty silver dollars on an acre and got back
sixteen or eighteen, how would he be benefited? The dollars
of outlay are of the same kind as the dollars of return
in any case. If it is true that the return does not equal the
outlay, it must be on account of some facts of production,
and it requires but a moment’s reflection to see that changing
the currency in which outlay and income are reckoned
cannot change the relation between the two.</p>

<p>A dispassionate view of facts will go to prove that the
world is reasonably and ordinarily prosperous at the present
time, except where particular classes and industries are
affected by special circumstances, as some classes and industries
are being affected at all times. The land-owners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
of western Europe are in distress on account of the competition
of new land, with cheapened means of transportation,
but now we are told that the holders of the other side
of the competition, the land-owners of the new soil, are victims
of distress. It must be, then, that too much labor and
capital are being expended on the soil the world over, and
that, too, in spite of all the protective tariffs drawing people
to the textile and metal industries. Our silver men say that
this is not the correct inference. They say that the people
on the new land suffer because the prices are set in coins
of gold and the debits and credits are kept in terms of those
coins. The prices are fixed in the world’s market in gold.
They will be so fixed, whatever we may do with our coinage
laws. If the proceeds, in being brought home, are converted
into silver value, a new opportunity for brokerage
and exchange gambling will be given to the hated bankers
and brokers of Wall Street. That is the only difference
which will be produced. It would be far more sensible to
say that distress is produced by doing the business on the
English system of weights and measures, in bushels and
pecks, and that prosperity would be produced by doing it
on the metric system, in litres and hectolitres, for that
charge would at least be harmless. Our distress could all
be dispelled in a week by an act of Congress making all
contracts, beyond political peradventure, that which they
are in law and fact, gold contracts.</p>

<p>There is, however, another cause of hard times for some
people which is far more important in our present case than
any other. That is the case of the boom which has collapsed.
We hear a great deal about “Wall Street gambling.”
The gambling in Wall Street is insignificant
compared with the gambling in land, buildings, town sites,
and crops which goes on all over the country, and which is
participated in chiefly by the men who declaim about
Wall Street. For three hundred years our history has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
been marked by the alternations of “prosperity” and “distress”
which are produced by the booms and their collapses.
When the collapse comes the people who are left
long of goods and land always make a great outcry and
start a political agitation. Their favorite device always is
to try to inflate the currency and raise prices again until
they can unload.</p>

<p>It is a very popular thing to tell men that they have a
grievance. That most of them find it hard to earn as much
money as they need to spend goes without saying. Now
comes the wily orator and tells them that this is somebody’s
fault. In old times, if a man was sick, it was always assumed
that somebody had bewitched him. The witch was
to be sought. The medicine-man had to name somebody,
and then woe to the one who was named. Our medicine-men
say that it is the gold-bugs, Wall Street, England, who
are to blame for hard times. Whether there is any rational
proof of connection is as immaterial as it always was in
witchcraft. It is a case of pain and passion. The “gold
standard” has done it! There is something to hate and denounce.
All would be well if silver could be coined at four
hundred and twelve and a half grains to the dollar. But
the assumption is that while the farmers would sell their
products for twice as many “dollars” as now, in silver, all
the prices of things which they want to buy would remain
at the same number of dollars and cents as now, in gold;
that is, it is believed that wheat would be at, say, one dollar
and fifty cents per bushel in silver, instead of seventy-five
cents in gold, but that cloth would remain at fifty
cents a yard in silver, if it is now fifty cents a yard in gold.
When this assumption is brought out into clear words, every
one knows that such can never be the result. The proposed
cure is like a witch cure. It lacks rational basis, and cannot
command the confidence of men of sense. If the times
were ever so bad, such a cure could only make them worse.</p>

AT EVERY POINT<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor smaller">37</a></h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Program.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> two former articles I have discussed some points
which are presented by the advocates of the free coinage
of silver, on the assumption that their project was
feasible and their conception of its operation correct.
They have laid out a program; free coinage, silver standard,
great demand for silver, rise of prices, rise in the value of
silver, cancellation of debts, prosperity. They now admit
that this program would involve a panic, but it would
come out, they say, at the desired result in two or three
years. They denounce the gold standard as having caused
hard times, but they plan a program with a panic as an
incident on the way to a silver standard as if it was a trifle.</p>

<p><em>There is not a step in this program which could or would
be carried out as planned.</em></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Free Silver Means Fiat Paper Money.</span></h3>

<p>The amount of circulating cash of all kinds in the hands
of the people at the present time is about nine hundred
millions. If the dollar was reduced to half its present
value, and if allowance was made for reserves, two thousand
million silver dollars would be the specie requirement
of the country. We already have nearly five hundred
millions of such dollars. Hence the country could not use
at the utmost, if the new silver dollar was worth not more
than half the present gold dollar, and if the total circulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
consisted of silver without any paper, but three times
as many more silver dollars as we have now. But every
one knows that such a state of the currency never would
exist. We should have paper “based on silver”; that is
to say, the silver inflation never will be carried out. It
will turn to paper inflation at the first step. Who can believe
that, if the silver standard was adopted, silver would
be bought and piled up dollar for dollar against the paper,
and that the paper would be issued only as fast as the silver
could be coined? In fact, silver would no doubt be dropped
and forgotten, and we should have plain and straightforward
fiat money of paper. Such ought to be faced as the
only real sense and probable outcome of the present agitation
for the free coinage of silver.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Limit of the Amount of Silver which could be
Absorbed.</span></h3>

<p>Let us, however, proceed upon the assumption that the
plan proposed is sincere, and that the attempt would be
made to carry it out in good faith. The circulation in the
hands of the people would be paper, for they would become
sick of silver and revolt against it. There would
then be two thousand million dollars in paper afloat, each
“dollar” being of silver and worth half a present gold one.
We have now five hundred million silver dollars. At the
utmost not more than another five hundred millions of
silver could be absorbed into the system. That would give
reserves of fifty per cent of the total currency, and that is
the maximum of the demand for silver which could be
created if the United States went over to the silver standard.
The supply would come from all over the earth. Mr.
St. John is sure that none would come from Europe, because
legal tender silver there is at a higher ratio than sixteen
to one. Not a nation in Europe which is now under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
the yoke of silver would hesitate a moment to demonetize
it and send it here if we opened our mints to it at sixteen to
one. He also assures us that none would come here from
the East because the course of silver has always been from
West to East. The course of silver has turned from East
to West more than once when there was a profit on bringing
it back, and that is the only condition necessary to bring
it back again. Japan would adopt a gold currency the moment
that the United States adopted a silver one.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">It is Impossible Indefinitely to Increase the
Circulation.</span></h3>

<p>The power of our currency to absorb silver is not unlimited.
People seem to believe that they can go on and
increase the monetary circulation indefinitely. This is
possible with paper, which has no commodity value and
cannot be exported, always understanding that the paper
will depreciate as issued, but it is not possible with any
money which has commodity value. When silver has been
put into circulation here to such an amount that all the
fictitious value given to it by the coinage law has been
eliminated—that is to say, when so many silver dollars,
or paper bearing the obligation of silver dollars, have been
issued as will equal in value the present circulation—then
there will be no profit in sending silver here from elsewhere,
and no more profit in minting silver here than in sending
it elsewhere. As we have seen, there is no reason to estimate
the amount of silver which would be absorbed in this operation
at more than five hundred millions. The miners
are making all this agitation for the sake of that share
which they could get in furnishing this sum. That share
would really not exceed the silver they had on hand when
the law was put in force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Antagonistic Interests of Miners and Populists.</span></h3>

<p>What share, then, would the silver-miners get in the
results of the enterprise? They could get none unless the
new silver was bought only of them, and only bought gradually
as they produced it, and bought at a rising price as
the demand of debtors acted upon it. Not one of these
conditions would be fulfilled. The debtors and the silver-miners
really have antagonistic interests at every point. It
has been proposed that only American silver should be accepted
at the mint. That plan is impracticable in any
case, but, when the Populists had their victory in hand,
does anybody suppose that they would wait eight or ten
years for the realization of their hopes while the mines
were producing new silver, being certain that that delay
would cause all they hoped for to slip through their fingers?
I repeat: The interests of the two factions are all antagonistic
to each other, and one of them is destined inevitably
to be the dupe of the other. That destiny is reserved
for the miners who, besides, are paying all the expenses.</p>

<p>Already, so far as the campaign has proceeded, this antagonism
has begun to manifest itself. Mr. Bryan says
that his plan will make silver worth one dollar and twenty-nine
cents per ounce fine. He thus takes his position with
the miners’ faction. Thereupon the organs of the repudiators’
faction have begun to remonstrate. That is not at
all what they are fighting for. They do not want their
scheme to raise silver at all. But if it does not, the miners
gain nothing. If it does, then again the repudiators take
to paper money and the miners win nothing.</p>

<p>The mechanical difficulty of recoining the silver with the
necessary rapidity could probably be overcome. There are
machine-shops enough to do it if there was a party in power
which had that reckless determination to execute its will
which these people show. We may, therefore, go on to
consider the rise of prices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Rise of Prices.</span></h3>

<p>The rise in prices would regularly occur only as the new
silver or paper was put out, but as the consequences would
all be discounted it would be sudden and rapid. It would
not, however, affect all things at the same time or to an
equal degree. It is here that one of the first disappointments
would occur. It is not possible to put up prices
when and as one would like to do it, even when the rise is
due to inflation. The effect cannot all be distributed at
once. An advance in price reacts on business relations,
that is, on the industrial organization. Many people and
many interests find that they cannot push against others
until long after they have been pushed against themselves.
The wages class and the farmers are the ones who are most
clearly in this position, at least as far as the latter do not
produce articles for export. It must be plain that in such
a convulsion of the market everybody will try to save himself
at the expense of others. Who will succeed? Those
certainly who spend their lives in the market and already
possess the control of its machinery; not those whose time
is occupied in the details of production.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Where the Expected Gains would Go.</span></h3>

<p>It is said that the farmer would sell his grain and cotton,
as now, for gold; that he would exchange the gold for
silver; would get the silver coined and would pay his
debts with it. Would any individual farmer do this?
Would any one man go through the steps of this operation?—see
the buyer of his products, handle the gold and silver,
go to the mint? Certainly not. All these operations
would go on through the commercial and financial machinery.
They would be executed by different individuals,
in the way of business, through the organization, and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
one of them would be lost to view. Every operation would
have to be paid for. Every operation would give a new
chance for more middlemen and more charges. Would,
then, the gains of this grand scheme go to the farmer?
Not at all. They would go to the “brokers and speculators
of Wall Street.” They would be lost in commissions
and charges. The type of operator whom the Populist
seems to think of when he talks about “Wall Street sharks,”
exists, although his importance in Wall Street is not
as great as that of the political farmer in agriculture; but
this type of man does not care what the currency legislation
is, except that he would like to have a great deal of it,
and to have it very mixed. Whatever it is, when it is
made and he sees what it is, he will proceed to operate
upon it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Playing into the Hands of the Money Sharks.</span></h3>

<p>We hear fierce denunciations of what is called the “money
power.” It is spoken of as mighty, demoniacal, dangerous,
and schemes are proposed for mastering it which are futile
and ridiculous, if it is what it is said to be. Every one of
these schemes only opens chances for money-jobbers and
financial wreckers to operate upon brokerages and differences
while making legitimate finance hazardous and
expensive, thereby adding to the cost of commercial operations.
The parasites on the industrial system flourish
whenever the system is complicated. Confusion, disorder,
irregularity, uncertainty are the conditions of their growth.
The surest means to kill them is to make the currency absolutely
simple and absolutely sound. Is it not childish
for simple, honest people to set up a currency system which
is full of subtleties and mysteries, and then to suppose that
they, and not the men of craft and guile, will get the profits
of it?</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Fifty</span> years ago a political agitation was started for
the annexation of Texas. As the enterprise appeared
like a barefaced piece of land-grabbing, it was necessary to
invent some historical, political, and moral theories which
would give it another color. One such theory was that
Texas had properly belonged to us, but that it was given
away by Monroe and Adams in 1819. Therefore the project
was presented as one for the <em>re</em>-annexation of Texas.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Re-monetization of Silver.</span></h3>

<p>An attempt is now made to impugn the coinage act of
1873 under various points of view, in order to lay a foundation
for the claim that it is only sought now to re-monetize
silver. Not a single imputation on the act of 1873 has ever
been presented which will stand examination, but, if that
were not so, that act was like any other act of Congress
which has become the law of the land, and under which
we have all been obliged to live for twenty-five years.
We cannot go back and undo the law and live the twenty-five
years over again. All the mistakes and follies of the
past are gone into the past for all classes and all persons
amongst us. The men of the past must be assumed to have
acted according to their light, and we who inherit the consequences
of what they did must make the best of both the
good and ill of it, as the case may be, or as we think it is.
If now we make a new coinage law it must stand on its own
merits, and on the responsibility of the men who make it,
now and for the future. All references back to 1873 are
idle and irrelevant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>The plain fact, therefore, to be faced without any disguise,
is that we are invited to debase the coinage and lower
the standard of value, <em>now</em> and for the future, as a free act
of political choice, to be deliberately adopted in a time of
profound peace, and that this is to be done with the intention
and hope that it will perpetrate a bankruptcy at fifty
cents on the dollar for all existing debtors. Can this project
be executed? It cannot. The scheme and plan of it for
a nation of seventy million people is silly and wicked at
the same time, and is both, beyond the power of words to
express. The projectors of it deal with the economic phenomena
of a great nation as if they were talking about a
game at cards, and they plan to do this with prices and
that with debts, this with exports and that with banks, as
if they were planning a program for building a barn. If
we try to realize the operation proposed we shall see how
childish and absurd it is.</p>

<p>We must distinguish between three classes of debtors:
great financial institutions, small mortgagors, and partners
in collapsed booms.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Financial Institutions as Debtors.</span></h3>

<p>The great financial institutions are intermediaries between
debtors and creditors. They have received capital
from some people and lent it to others. They have to
recover it and pay it back. If they only recover it at fifty
cents on the dollar, they can only repay it in the same way.
What this would mean is that the creditors of those institutions
would be paid “dollars,” but that when they tried to
re-invest them they would find that prices had risen to a
greater or less degree in those dollars for the things which
they wanted to buy. To this the Populists answer, triumphantly,
that now the debtors find that the prices of
their products have fallen, so that when they try to sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
them they cannot get enough to pay their debts; but the
debtors are those who made contracts and undertook enterprises
five, ten, fifteen, or twenty years ago, expecting to
make gains which they certainly would have kept. As
things have turned out they have not made the gains, and
their plan is to escape the loss by throwing it on some one
else. The institutions in question, however, are bound to
protect the interests of either body of their clients, borrowers
or depositors, when either is unjustly threatened, and
they are by no means destitute of means to do it. A law
to forbid specific coin contracts is but one step in the desperate
policy of prostituting law and corrupting the administration
of justice, which would be necessary in the
attempt to force through the plan under discussion. It
would fail at last, because the advocates of it would find
that, as the popular saying is, it would “fly up and hit
them in the face.” It is not possible to throw society and
all its most important institutions into confusion without
ruining all the interests of everybody, and at last everybody
but the tramp or pauper has to ask himself whether
it will pay. As for the institutions, many of them would
be ruined in the operation. It is not possible for them
simply to collect and repay in the debased dollars. The
operation would produce snarls and knots at every turn.
Lawsuits would multiply on all sides, and would so entangle
the affairs of the institution as to ruin it. The proof
of this is presented by the difficulties of liquidation in any
case, even when there is no question of currency revolution,
and when general affairs are in a normal condition,
unless there is time and security for all the operations. In
this case the demands on the institution would be precipitated
at once, so far as the form of contract would allow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Small Mortgagors.</span></h3>

<p>The small mortgagors are either wages-men or farmers.
As to the wages-men, their wages would undoubtedly go
up in time as prices went up, but in the paralysis of industry
which would be the first distinct effect of the plan, as
soon as it was known that the experiment was to be made,
immense numbers of wages-men would be thrown out of
employment, and all wages would fall on account of this
condition of the labor market. Later, when things began
to adjust themselves to the new basis, wages would be low
with prices high, both in silver. Advance of wages would
come, but it would have to be won through strikes and a
prolonged industrial war. In the state of things supposed
it would be every man for himself. The wages class would
be weakest of all under the circumstances, as they are in
every case of “hard times.” How would mortgagors of
this class traverse such a time and keep up their interest?
As to the principal, which is to be halved, it cannot be
halved unless it is paid, and the mortgagor has nothing
to pay it with except the <em>surplus</em> which he can save from
his wages over the cost of living. The project promises woe
and ruin to the wages class, with industrial war and class
hatred as moral consequences of the most far-reaching
importance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Farmer-Mortgagors.</span></h3>

<p>The farmers expect to double the price of their products,
and so get silver to pay off their mortgages. It has
been shown elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> how illusory this expectation is as
regards prices. Prices would rise, indeed, in silver, but
irregularly and unequally. They would rise for all things
which a farmer buys as well as for all that he sells. If, as
the silver theorists generally say, all prices were to rise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
uniformly, the farmer would gain but little. For the only
means he would win toward paying off his mortgage would
be the <em>surplus</em> of his income over his outgo, and this he
could only apply year by year as he won it. If, then, the
whole scheme could be made to work smoothly provided the
victims of it would submit to it without resistance, does
this afford any probability of realizing the great hopes
which are built upon the scheme?</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Social War the Consequence.</span></h3>

<p>But victims would not submit without resistance, and
once more we come to the result that no effect can be expected
from this undertaking but social war, and a convulsion
of the entire social system, whose consequences
defy analysis or prediction. If a man says that he “does
not see” what great difference going over to the silver standard
will make, it must be that he is little trained to understand
the workings of the industrial system in which he
lives and on which he depends. It is a monstrous thing
that a free, self-governing people should join a political
battle, in this year of grace 1896, over the question whether
to debase their coinage or not.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Exploded Booms.</span></h3>

<p>The third class of debtors is by far the most important
in this matter—those who are caught in exploded booms.
The peaceful and honest mortgagors of farms and homesteads
are not the ones who have gotten up this political
agitation. The jobbers, speculators, and boom-promoters
have been one of the curses of this country from the earliest
colonial days. They are men of the “hustling” type, jobbing
in politics with one hand and in land or town lots
with the other. It is they who, at the worst periods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
financial trouble in our history, have always appeared in
the lobby, eager for “relief,” declaiming about the
“people,” the “money power,” the “banks,” “England,”
etc. They have always favored schemes for fraudulent
banks, or paper money, or state subsidies, or other plans
by which they could unload on the state or on their creditors.
Just now it is silver, because silver has fallen within
twenty-five years so much that it is what is called “cheap
money.” This type of men have always used a dialect,
part of which is quoted above, which is so well marked
that it suffices to identify them. The history of financial
distress in this country is full of it. No scheme which
has ever been devised by them has ever made a collapsed
boom go up again. With very few exceptions, they have,
on account of such expedients, only floundered deeper in
the mire. The exceptions have been those who have succeeded
in making the state provide them with capital, although
by no means all of these have been hard-headed
enough to use it to “get out.” Generally they believe in
themselves and their schemes, and use new capital only to
plunge in again still deeper.</p>

<p>It is men of this class and the silver-miners who have
brought the present trouble upon us, who have invented
and preached the notions about the crime of ’73, the hard
times, the magical influence of silver, and all the rest. It
is they who have filled and engineered conventions. They
will gain no more now than in any former crisis, but they
insist on involving us all in turmoil, risk, and ruin by their
schemes to save themselves.</p>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Legislative History of the Act of 1873.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is alleged that the law of 1873 was enacted surreptitiously.
Mr. Bryan is quoted as having said that the
free-coinage men only ask for a restoration of “that system
that we had until it was stricken down in the dark without
discussion.” Within the last ten years the facts of the legislative
history of that law have been published over and
over again. They are to be found in the report of the
Comptroller of the Currency for 1876, page 170; in “Macpherson’s
Political Manual” for 1890, page 157, and in
“Sound Currency,” Vol. III, No. 13. The bill was before
Congress three years, was explained and debated again and
again. The fact that the silver dollar was dropped was
expressly pointed out. It is not now justifiable for any
man who claims to be honest and responsible to assert that
it was passed “in the dark and without discussion.” The
fact is that nobody cared about it. It is noteworthy that
the act is not in “Macpherson’s Manual” for 1874. It was
not thought to be of any importance. It was not until
after the panic of 1873 that attention began to be given to
the currency. To that, I who write can testify, since I tried
in vain, before that time, to excite any interest in the subject.
I was once in the gallery of the House of Representatives
when a question of coinage was before the House. I
counted those members who, as far as I could judge, were
paying any attention. There were six. What is it necessary
to do in such a case in order to prevent the claim,
twenty-five years later, when countless interests have vested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
under the law, that the law is open to “reversal” because
it was passed “in the dark”?</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Was it Passed Surreptitiously?</span></h3>

<p>How can a law be passed through Congress surreptitiously?
We have indeed heard of bills being “smuggled
through” in the confusion attending the last hours
of the session, or as an amendment, or under a misleading
title. There are the rules of order, however, by which
all legislation is enacted. All laws which get through the
mill are equally valid. There never has been and never
can be any distinction drawn between them according to
their legislative history. In the present case there was not
the slightest manœuvre or trick, nor is there even room to
trump up an allegation of the kind.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">That the People Did Not Know of It.</span></h3>

<p>It is said that “the people” did not know what was
being done. How do they ever know what is being done?
There is all the machinery of publicity, and it is all at
work. If people do not heed (and of course in nearly all
cases they do not), whose fault is it? Who is responsible to
go to the ten million voters individually and make sure that
they heed, lest twenty-five years later somebody may say
that the fact that they did not heed lays down a justification
for a new project which certainly is “a crime” in the
new sense which is given to that word here?</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Motive of the Law.</span></h3>

<p>The act of 1873 did not affect any rights or interests. It
took away an option which had existed since 1834, but had
never been used, and, for ten years before this act was
passed, had sunk entirely out of sight under paper-money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
inflation. Secretary Boutwell, when he first brought the
matter to the attention of Congress in 1870, explained the
proposed legislation as a codification of existing coinage
laws. Later it took the shape of a complete simplification
of existing law, history, and fact, in order to put the coinage
on the simplest and best system as a basis for resumption.
As we had then no coin, we had a free hand to put
the system on the best basis, there being no vested rights
or interests to be disturbed. That this was a wise and sound
course to pursue under the circumstances is unquestionable.
Three years later, by the rise in greenbacks and the
fall in silver, it came about that four hundred twelve and
one-half grains of silver, nine-tenths fine, was worth a little
less than a greenback dollar. The old option would, therefore,
if still existent, have been an advantage to debtors.
Complaint and clamor for the restoration of the option
then began, but to give such an option, after the market
had changed, would be playing with loaded dice. The
European countries which still retained the option abolished
it as soon as silver began to fall, and we, if we had retained
it open until that time, ought to have done the same.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Alternate Ruin to Debtors and Creditors.</span></h3>

<p>The inflation of the Civil War had a direful effect upon
all creditors on contracts outstanding in 1862. The resumption
of specie payments had a similar effect on debtors under
contracts made between 1868 and 1878. Greenbackism
and silver debasement were produced by resistance to this
operation. The debtors of to-day are not those of that
period. The debts of that period are paid off. The pain
and strain have been borne. The credit of the United
States has been established, the currency restored, and the
whole business of the country for seventeen years has been
completely established on the gold dollar as the dollar of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
account for all transactions whatsoever. The population
of the country is now two and a half times what it was in
the war time, and its wealth is probably a much greater
multiple. The debts now outstanding have, with unimportant
exceptions, been contracted since the resumption
of specie payments. What is now proposed is to enter
upon a new period of these alternations of wrong and injustice,
first to creditors, then to debtors, and so on, and
to do this in a time of peace, not from any political necessity,
but on the ground of some economic interpretations
of the facts of the market, which are incapable of verification
and proof, when they are not obviously erroneous and
partisan. The effect of the various compromises with
silver is that the currency is once more intricate and complicated,
excessive and confused, so that few can understand
it, and it offers all sorts of chances for perverse and
mischievous interpretations.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Demonetization Removed No Money from Use.</span></h3>

<p>The law of 1873 never threw a dollar of silver or other
currency out of circulation. We hear it asserted that “demonetization”
destroyed half the people’s money. People
say this who know nothing of the facts, but infer that demonetization
must mean that some silver dollars which
were money had that character taken from them. No one
of the other demonetizations, which took place in Europe
at about the same time, diminished the money in use.
The result of changes in 1873–1874 was that the amount
of silver coin in use in Europe was greatly increased, and
has remained so since.</p>

<p>The resumption of specie payments after 1873 by a
number of nations which had issued paper money in the
previous period, and the alternate expenditure and re-collection
of war-hoards of gold, had far greater importance
than the demonetizations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>There has been no diminution of the world’s coined
money within fifty years, but a steady and rapid increase
of it. There have been fluctuations in the production of
gold and silver such as belong to the production of all
metals and are inevitable.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Alleged Scramble for Gold.</span></h3>

<p>There has been no “scramble for gold.” Those who do
not put any obstacle in the way of gold get more of it than
they want. The Bank of England has had lately the largest
stock of gold that it ever had, and complaints have
begun to be heard of a glut. The gold-production in the
last five years is the greatest ever known and there is no
fear of any lack of it, whatever may be the sense in which
any one chooses to speak of a “lack.” There is not and
has not been any “scarcity of gold.” There is no such thing
conceivable, except where paper has been issued in excess,
so that it is hard to keep enough gold to redeem it with.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Proof that there has been no Scarcity of Gold.</span></h3>

<p>There is one proof that there has been no scarcity of
money for twenty-five years past which has not indeed
passed unnoticed, but which has not received the attention
which it deserves; that is the rate of interest. The rate
of interest is normally due to the supply and demand of
loanable capital, and has nothing to do with money. The
value of money is registered by prices, not by the rate of
interest. But whenever there is a special demand for
money of account—that is, for the solvent of debts—the
rate of interest on capital passes over into a rate for the
solvent of debts. Banks lend capital in its most universal
form, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the currency or money of account, or bank
credits. If credit fails, as in a time of crisis and panic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
actual cash in the money of account is wanted. This now
is loaned, under a rate, by the same persons and institutions
who formerly loaned capital, and the one phenomenon
passes into the other without any line of demarcation.
The transition, however, never takes place except in time
of crisis, and therefore at a <em>high</em> rate. From this it follows
certainly that never when the market rate is <em>low</em> can it be
a rate for the solvent of debts. Now, ever since 1873, with
the exception of periods of special stringency in 1884, 1890,
and 1893, we have had very low rates of interest; the rate
for call loans (which in this connection are the most important)
has been about two per cent. This is a demonstration
that the country has not been suffering from a
crisis on account of a lack of currency for the normal needs
of business. Proofs could be presented, on the other hand,
that the currency for the last six years has been constantly
in excess, excepting in 1893, when the credit of the currency
failed for a time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Get Poor and Rich at the Same Time.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. St. John tries his hand at the relation between prices
and interest in connection with our subject. He says:
“If the dollar can be cheapened by increasing the number
of dollars, so that each dollar will buy less wheat, the increasing
price of wheat will increase the demand for dollars
to invest in its production.” Evidently he fails to distinguish
between the rise in price of wheat from one gold
dollar to two gold dollars per bushel, and the rise in wheat
from one gold dollar to two fifty-cent silver dollars per
bushel. The former would undoubtedly stimulate production.
The latter would do so also, among farmers who
shared Mr. St. John’s confusion on this matter. There
would be many of them. They would imagine that they
were getting rich by raising wheat to sell at two silver dollars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
or five, ten, fifteen, or twenty paper dollars, as depreciation
went on. Hence, as he says, they would pay a
banker eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen per cent, in the depreciated
dollars, in order to get “money,” as he calls it,
with which to raise wheat. Mr. St. John thinks that this
would mean that farmer and banker were both magnificently
prosperous. It would mean that the real value
which came in was steadily growing less than that which
went out, so that the capital was being consumed. Hence
the high rates of inflation times, and the disaster which
follows when the truth is realized. They told a story in
Revolutionary times of a man who invested his capital in a
hogshead of rum which he sold out at an enormous advance—in
Continental paper; but when he went to buy
a new supply, all his “money” would only buy a barrel.
This he retailed out at another enormous advance—in
Continental—but when he went to buy more he had only
enough money to buy a gallon. If he had borrowed his
first capital he might have paid twenty per cent for it—in
Continental—but the banker would hardly have made
a good affair.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Monopoly of the Money.</span></h3>

<p>We hear it asserted that the gold standard gives the
owners of gold power to appropriate the money and make
it scarce, and that they have used this power. Why, then,
under silver or paper, may not the holders of silver or paper
do the same? That the holders of gold have not done it
has been shown above. But nobody can do it with any
kind of value money. There are no “holders of gold.”
He who holds gold wins no gains on it. The bankers who
are supposed to hold it, if peace and security reign, put it
all out at loan in order to get gain on it. When peace and
security do not reign it is not safe to put it out, and borrowers,
fearing to engage in new enterprises, do not present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
a demand for it. Furthermore, the greatest gains can then
be won by holding money ready to buy property when the
crash comes. That is what those who own surpluses are
doing now. Hence there are no “holders of gold” until
monetary threats and dangers call them into existence.
Silver legislation has made a great many. The law of 1873
never made any.</p>

<p>There is not, therefore, a fact or deduction about the law
of 1873, or the history of the market since, which the silver
men have put forward, which will stand examination.</p>

<span class="subhead">[1878]</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> seems as if the United States were destined to be the
arena for testing experimentally every fallacy in regard
to money which has ever been propounded. A few
years ago only a very few people here had ever heard of
the “double standard” or knew what it meant. In 1873
we became simply and distinctly a “gold country” in law,
as we had been for forty years in fact. Immediately after
that date silver began to fall in value relatively to gold,
so that, if we had been on the “double standard,” and had
not been deterred by considerations of honor, morality,
and public credit, which considerations kept the double-standard
countries from taking that course, we could have
paid our debts in silver at an advantage. Forthwith all
those persons who had before been racking their brains to
devise some scheme for resumption without pain or sacrifice,
turned their attention to silver, and began to devise
plans for getting back to the position which, as they thought,
we had unwisely abandoned. The consequence has been
that, for the last year, the country has produced numberless
editorials, essays, lectures, and speeches, full of the most
crude sophistry, and the most astonishing errors as to all
the elementary doctrines of coinage and money. The
favorite object of all these schemes is to find some means
of increasing the amount of money at the disposal of the
world, or of this nation, so as to raise prices and make it
easier to pay debts. These schemes have taken their
point of departure in the speculations of some European<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
economists. In Europe the propositions of the economists
in question have never passed beyond the realm of speculation
and theoretical discussion amongst professional
economists. They have been regarded by some as probably
sound, and capable of being made the basis of advantageous
legislation. By others, superior in number and
authority, they have been regarded as unsound. Inasmuch
as they involve an international coinage union between
all civilized countries and could be put to the experiment
only on a scale involving immeasurable risks, the overwhelming
judgment has been that they were out of the
question. Here, however, our amateurs and empirics are
in hot haste to make the experiments, without any coinage
convention, or with the coöperation of only a few and the
less important nations, that is to say under circumstances
which even the most extreme bimetallists condemn as
ruinous.</p>

<p>It must be observed then that there lies back of all this
popular discussion a scientific and technical question of
great delicacy. I might even say that it is a speculative
question, or a question in speculative economics, for we
have no experience of an international coinage union, or of
a concurrent circulation, of the metals. We have to imagine
the state of things proposed and reason <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> as
to what must be the result. There is a postulate to all
these schemes which has never been expressed and never
been discussed, but which is assumed to be true. It has
two different forms: (1) A concurrent circulation of gold
and silver may be established in any country: (2) A concurrent
circulation of gold and silver may be established
by a coinage union of all civilized nations. These postulates,
or we may say this postulate, for the latter includes
the former, I have now to bring in question. If the science
of money teaches that there cannot be a concurrent circulation
of the metals, then the schemes which I have referred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
to are all condemned. The question, moreover, has
won such an immediate and practical significance in the
country that it is no longer a subject for academical discussion
amongst economists, about whom opinions may
differ without importance.</p>

<p>The Senate of the United States has just passed a bill
containing the following provision:</p>

<p>“Sec. 2. That immediately after the passage of this act
the President shall invite the governments of the countries
composing the Latin Union, so called, and of such other
European nations as he may deem advisable, to join the
United States in a conference to adopt a common ratio between
gold and silver for the purpose of establishing internationally
the use of bimetallic money and securing a
fixity of the relative value between those metals; such
conference to be held at such a place in Europe or in the
United States at such a time within six months as may be
mutually agreed upon by the executives of the governments
joining in the same. Whenever the governments so invited,
or any three of them, shall have signified their willingness
to unite in the same, the President shall, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint three commissioners
who shall attend such conference on behalf of
the United States, and shall report the doings thereof to
the President, who shall transmit the same to Congress.”</p>

<p>The conception which governed this legislation is plain
enough. It proposes to secure a concurrent circulation of
the two metals at a fixed ratio by an international agreement.
The proposition is to put the experiment at work
when only three nations besides ourselves consent and in
the meantime to remonetize silver here at sixteen to one
when the market ratio is seventeen and one-half to one.
This adds to the absurdity of the bill, but has no
bearing on my present controversy. I challenge the
postulate which is assumed, which has never been discussed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
much less proved, that a concurrent circulation
is possible if an international union can be made. Anybody
who concedes this concedes, as I view it, the
fundamental and controlling error in the silver craze. If
this premise is conceded, there can be no further controversy
on the arena of science. It remains only to try to
overcome practical difficulties. Such is the issue I raise
with those who, under any reservations whatsoever, concede
that a concurrent circulation is possible. In a body
of scientific gentlemen I need only refer to the mischief
done in science by assuming the truth of postulates without
examination, and I need make no apology for bringing
forward with all possible force and vigor a controversy on
a point so essential. It is my duty to say that I may be in
error, and I have the misfortune to differ here with gentlemen
from whom I dissent seldom and unwillingly, but it
will not be denied that, while there is controversy on a
point so essential, and at a moment when practical measures
of high importance to every person in this country
are proposed, based on certain views of the matter, I am
right in promoting discussion. I wish to be understood as
paying full respect to everybody, but I address myself,
without compliments, to the question in hand. I shall be
satisfied if I make it appear that I have some strong grounds
for the position I take in a long, careful, and mature study
of this question in all its bearings.</p>

<p>It will economize time and space, if, before entering on
my subject, I try to clear up two points: (1) what is an
economic force or an economic law, and how ought we to
go about the study of economic phenomena? (2) What is
a legal tender?</p>

<p>(1) What should be our conception of an economic
force or an economic law, and how ought we to study
economic phenomena? Some people seem to think that
economic phenomena constitute a domain of arbitrary and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
artificial action. They think that social phenomena of
every kind are subject to chance or to control. They see
no sequence between incidents of this kind. They have
no conception of social forces. They think economic laws
are only formulae established by grouping a certain number
of facts together, like a rule in grammar, and they are
prepared for a list of exceptions to follow. This conception,
in its grosser forms, is now banished from the science,
but it still has strong hold on popular opinion. It also
still colors a great many scientific discussions, those, namely,
who seek to carry forward the science by following out the
complicated cases produced by the combined action of
economic forces in our modern industrial life, and describing
them in detail. In my opinion such efforts are all
mistaken.</p>

<p>I regard economic forces as simply parallel to physical
forces, arising just as spontaneously and naturally, following
a sequence of cause and effect just as inevitably as
physical forces—neither more nor less. The perturbations
and complications which present themselves in social
phenomena are strictly analogous to those which appear in
physical phenomena. The social order is, to my mind,
the product of social forces tending always towards an
equilibrium at some ideal point, which point is continually
changing under the ever-changing amount or velocity of the
forces or under their new combinations. Consequently, I
do not believe that the advance of economic science depends
upon fuller and more minute description of complicated
social phenomena as they present themselves in experience,
but on a stricter analysis of them in order to get a closer
and clearer knowledge of the laws by which the forces producing
them operate. If this can be attained, all the complications
which arise from their combined action will be
easily solved. Of course we have peculiar difficulties to
contend with, inasmuch as we cannot constitute experiments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
and it is necessary to rely largely upon historical
cases which present now one and now another force or set
of forces in peculiar prominence. The facts which show
the difficulty of the task, however, have nothing to do
with its nature.</p>

<p>According to this view of the matter there is no more
reason to be satisfied with generalities in economics than
in physics. Some writers on economic subjects, who
pride themselves upon scientific reluctance, remind me of
Mr. Brooks, in “Middlemarch.” They believe in things
up to a certain point, and are always afraid of going too
far. They would be careful about the multiplication table,
and not bear down too hard on the rule of three. They
do not discriminate between care in the application of rules,
and confidence in scientific results; or between harshness
in personal relations and firm convictions in science. The
more we come to understand economic science the more
clear it is that we are dealing with only another presentation
of matter and force, that is to say, with quantity and law,
so that we have mathematical relations, and have every
encouragement to severity and exactitude in our methods.
When, therefore, it is said that the economists do not pay
sufficient heed to the power of legislation, that is no stopping
place for the argument any more than it would be in
physics to say that sufficient heed was not paid to friction.
The question would then arise: What is the force of legislation?
Let us study it, just as we would go on to study
friction in mechanics. When it is loosely said (as if that
dismissed the subject) that men have passions and emotions
and do not act by rule, the objection is not pertinent
at all. It is connected with another wide and common,
but very erroneous notion, that economic laws involve
some stress of obligation on men to do or abstain from
doing certain things. I suppose this notion arises from the
classification of political economy amongst the moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
sciences. Economic laws only declare relations of cause and
effect which will follow, if set in motion. Whether a man
sets the sequence in motion at all or not, and if he does so,
whether he does it from passion or habit or upon reflection,
is immaterial. Such is the case, as I understand it, with
all sciences. They simply instruct men as to the laws of
this world in which we live that they may know what to
expect if they take one course or another, or they instruct
men so that they may understand the relations of phenomena
of forces beyond our control so that we may foresee
and guard ourselves against harm. It follows from all
this that I demand and aim at just as close thinking in
political economy as in any other science. I think we must
try to get as firm hold of principles and fundamental laws
as we can, and that, especially in the face of speculative
propositions, we ought to cling to and trust the firmly established
laws of the science.</p>

<p>(2) As to legal tender, it seems to me that the public
mind has been sadly confused under the régime of paper
money. Money is any commodity which is set apart by
common consent to serve as a medium of exchange. If
it is a commodity, it will exchange by the laws of value,
and will therefore serve to measure value. It must therefore
be a commodity, an object of desire requiring onerous
exertion to get it. In theory, it may be any commodity.
The question as to what commodity is a question of convenience—that
one which will answer the purpose best.
Through a long period of experiments we have come to use
gold or silver, simply because we found them the best.
Convenience here gave rise to custom, and money of gold
or silver owes its existence to custom entirely, and not to
law at all. Law has only in very few instances even selected
that one of the two metals which should be used.
Even that has come about through custom. Law, therefore,
here as elsewhere where it has been beneficent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
not arbitrary, has followed custom, recognized it, ratified
it, and given it sanctions. (1) A legal tender law,
therefore, where customary money is used, simply declares
that the parties to a contract shall not vex each other by
arbitrarily departing from the custom. The creditor shall
not demand, and the debtor shall not offer, out of spite
or malice, anything but the customary money of the nation.
Such a legal tender law has no significance whatever.
No one thinks of it or speaks of it or takes it into account,
unless he be one of those whose idle malice it prevents.</p>

<p>(2) A legal tender law is used where a subsidiary token
currency is employed as a part of the system, to prevent
debtors from using it in payment, and to prevent the system
from bringing about a depreciation of the money. In this
case it is part of the device for using a token currency, and
is open to no objection. It would check the debtor when
he meant to perpetrate a wrong. It would not enable
him to do one.</p>

<p>(3) A legal tender law has been used very often, however,
to give forced circulation to a depreciated currency
of little or no value as a commodity. In that case the legal
tender act enables the debtor to discharge his obligations
with less commodities than he and the creditor understood
and expected when the contract was made. If the creditor
appeals to the courts, they are obliged to rule that the
debtor has discharged his obligation, when he has not,
and they give the creditor no relief. Hence it appears
that a legal tender act giving forced circulation to depreciated
currency amounts simply to this: it withdraws the
protection of the courts from one party to a contract, and
leaves him at the mercy of the other party to the extent
of the depreciation of the currency. Obviously no other
act of legislation more completely reverses the whole
proper object of legislation, or more thoroughly subverts
civil order. The English passed two or three acts of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
nature, although they were not specifically acts for making
banknotes legal tender, during the bank suspension at the
beginning of this century. It would have been interesting
to see what English courts would have made of an act
which reversed the whole spirit of English law by diminishing
the rights of one party under a contract, and which
made the courts an instrument for his oppression instead
of an institution to provide a remedy, but no case came up.
The twelve judges on appeal overturned the sentence of a
man convicted of buying and selling gold at a premium.
Some few persons demanded and obtained gold payments
throughout the suspension but the paper circulation was
really sustained by public opinion and consent, it being
believed that the bank suspension was necessary. This
form of legal tender, therefore, is totally different from
that first described. I call it, for the sake of discrimination,
a forced circulation. When a legal tender act giving
forced circulation to a depreciated currency is first passed,
if it applies to existing contracts it transfers a percentage
of all capital engaged in credit operations from the creditor
to the debtor. In its subsequent action it subjects either
party to the fluctuations which may occur in the forced
circulation, robbing first one and then another. Hence
the debtor interest is that the depreciation once begun
shall go on steadily, because any recovery would rob
debtors as creditors were robbed in the first place.</p>

<p>Having disposed of these two points I now take up the
question I proposed at the outset: Is a concurrent circulation
of gold and silver possible under an international
coinage union?</p>

<p>Here we have to make a radical distinction between two
different propositions for an international coinage union.
The first is that of M. Wolowski. He pointed to the comparatively
small fluctuations of the precious metals and to
the effect which France had exerted by the double standard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
and inferred that if all civilized nations would join France
in her system they might arrest the fall of either metal
before it became important. If the coinage union fixed
upon a ratio of one to fifteen and one-half, then, if silver fell
all would use silver, which would arrest its fall. If gold
should fall, all would use gold. As the metal in use would
always be the one which was cheaper than the legal ratio,
the other would be above it, if I may so express it. Hence
neither would be permanently demonetized, because neither
could fall so low as to go out of use. Only one would be
used at a time but the other would be within reach, and if
either should rise relatively to commodities, debtors would
not suffer but might even be benefited by being enabled
to turn to the falling metal. This system would require of
the law nothing except to prescribe that the mint should
coin either metal indifferently which people might bring,
silver coins being made fifteen and one-half times as heavy
as gold coins of the same denomination, both being of the
same fineness. This is Wolowski’s plan, and these are the
advantages he expected from it. He thought that it
would hold the alternative open between the two metals.
He feared that silver, if universally demonetized, would
fall so low as to go out of use entirely for money. He
thought that France and, later, the Latin Union ought not
to bear alone the cost of keeping up the value of silver.
He thought the debtor ought not to be oppressed by being
forced to rely on one metal alone which might rise relatively
to commodities. He did not propose to give the debtor
the use of the whole mass of both metals at the same time.
Indeed that arrangement would defeat Wolowski’s purpose,
for if the whole mass of both metals could be brought into
use at once prices would rise. Those who are indebted
now would win, but when prices and credit had adjusted
themselves to the bimetallic money the effect would be
exhausted. Debts contracted after that would be relatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
just as heavy to pay as they are now, and if the precious
metals taken together rose relatively to commodities,
debtors would have no recourse to anything else. Now
this chance of recourse, when the standard of value rose,
was just what Wolowski wanted. His language is very
guarded and scientific. He never went further than to
say that his scheme would restrain and limit the fluctuations
of the metals—how far he did not know and did not
pretend to say. He thought the fluctuations would be so
narrow that the transition from one metal to the other
would be a relief to debtors without any appreciable injustice
to creditors. All this is very clear and very sensible.
On theory it is open to no radical objection. The discussion
of it turns upon considerations of practicability and
expediency. It is much to be wished that this plan should
be called by its proper name: the alternative standard,
or, better still, the alternate standard. It counts among
its adherents a number of strong men, and many others
have signified assent to it on theoretical grounds.</p>

<p>The term “bimetallism” ought to be restricted to
another theory of which Cernuschi is the advocate,
which has for its purpose to unite the two metals at once
in the circulation and give debtors the whole mass of both
metals as a means of payment. Cernuschi believes that
the international coinage union could arrest the fluctuations
of the metals entirely; or that there is some narrow
limit of fluctuation within which both would remain in
use, and that the coinage union could hold the value-fluctuations
of the metals within these limits. The American
schemes are numerous and so crude that it is difficult
to analyze or classify them. They are also of many different
grades. They all, however, seem to have this in
common, that they want to secure to the debtor the use
of both metals at once, and that they aim at a concurrent
circulation. They must, therefore, be classed under bimetallism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
These schemes all involve not simply what
Wolowski said—that legislation and union could limit the
fluctuations—but the proposers know how much it would
limit them, and they can control the results. This view
has very few adherents in Europe. It has not been discussed
there save by one or two writers. It is passed by
in silence for reasons which I shall soon show.</p>

<p>The opinion has been expressed that these two propositions
differ only in degree. From this opinion I must express
my earnest dissent. It is the very cardinal point of
my present argument. Wolowski’s alternate standard seems
to me to rest upon the belief that legislation of the kind
proposed would restrict the fluctuations in value of the
metals. It affirms that legislation would have a certain
tendency. Any plan for a concurrent circulation giving
debtors the use of the whole mass of both metals pretends
to say how far the tendency would go and what its results
would be. To my mind the difference between those two
propositions is that between a scientific and an unscientific
proposition. We have a parallel case before us. Some
say re-monetization would cause an advance in silver.
Others say re-monetization would make a four hundred and
twelve and one-half grain silver dollar equal in value to a
gold one. Are those two propositions the same save in
degree? It seems to me that only a very superficial
consideration of them could so declare. Obviously they
differ in quality more than in degree. The former of
these propositions is not false in principle; the question
in regard to it must be decided by circumstances. The
second is false and erroneous from beginning to end,
and would be false even if temporarily and by force of
circumstances the silver dollar should become equal to
the gold dollar, because it rests, like the old doctrine that
nature abhors a vacuum, upon false views of all the forces
involved. Just so with regard to a concurrent circulation or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
bimetallism as compared with the alternate standard.
The latter predicts tendencies to arise from the play of
certain forces. Those tendencies are the true effect of
those forces. The question may be raised whether the
means proposed would bring those forces into action,
whether they would be as great as is expected, whether
they would be counteracted by others, but there is no
error as to the nature and operation of economic forces.
Bimetallism predicts results, not tendencies. It assumes
to measure the consequences and say what will result as
a permanent state of things. It therefore involves the
doctrine that legislation can control natural forces for
definite results. If legislation cannot so control natural
forces, then we cannot secure a concurrent circulation,
giving the debtor the use of the whole mass of both metals
with which to pay his debts. At a time like this, when the
silver craze seems to be asserting itself as a mania, by
sweeping away some who ought to be most staunch in their
adherence to economic laws and most clear in their perception
of economic truths, I may be pardoned for insisting
most strenuously upon this distinction and upon its importance.
Many of the American writers have been betrayed
into error by not having examined these two plans
and discriminated between them with sufficient care. It
is very common to see arguments based upon the alternate
standard and inferences drawn as to bimetallism which
are entirely fallacious because they cross the gulf between
the two theories without recognizing it. Bimetallism is so
plainly opposed to fundamental doctrines of political
economy that few European economists have felt called
upon to discuss it. Here the case is different, and the more
ground it wins, and the more danger there is that it will
affect legislation, the more urgent is the necessity to resist
every form of it.</p>

<p>Now my proposition is that a concurrent circulation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
that is a permanent union of the two metals in the coinage,
so that the debtor can use both or either, is impossible.
Permanent stability of the metals in the coinage, whether
with or without an international coinage union, is just as
impossible in economics as perpetual motion is in physics.
Against perpetual motion the physicist sets a broad and
complete negation, because action and reaction are equal.
He does not care what the principle may be on which any
one may try to construct perpetual motion. If any one
brings to him a perpetual motion perhaps he will spend
time to examine and analyze it and show how it contravenes
the great law of motion. I claim that a concurrent
circulation is impossible on any scheme or under any circumstances
because it contravenes the law of value. Value
fluctuates under supply and demand at a limit fixed by
what Cairnes calls cost of production, or Jevons calls the
final increment of utility, or Walras calls scarcity, all of
which on analysis will be found to be the same thing.
Bimetallism affirms that, under legislation, although supply
and demand may vary, value shall not. In order to
test this let us next examine the influence of legislation on
value.</p>

<p>The cases in which legislation acts on value are all cases
of monopoly. Such is the case with token money; such is
the case with irredeemable paper. As with every other
monopoly, the successful manipulation of these monopolies
consists in controlling supply, to fit the supply to the
demand at the price which the monopolist wants to get.
The history of every monopoly shows the great difficulty,
I might say, in the long run, the impossibility, of doing
this. The bimetallists propose not to act on the supply,
and so create a monopoly, but to act upon the demand.
This is a new exercise of legislation, different from any
yet tried, and not guaranteed by any experience. Now to
act upon the demand is, in the phrase of the stock brokers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
to make a corner, that is to buy all that is offered at a price.
Stock gamblers do this so as to sell out again at an advance
to those who are forced to buy. If there are none who are
forced to buy, then those who bought above the market
have lost their capital. The propositions of the advocates
of the alternate standard and of bimetallism are alike in
proposing that all civilized nations shall combine to make
a corner on the falling metal. Whether that is a worthy
undertaking or not I will not stop to inquire. It is evident
that the nations of the coinage union would have no one on
whom to unload after they had bought, and that there would
be an inevitable loss and waste of capital in the transaction.
This, however, is not all. A corner is effective or not according
to its scope. It must embrace the whole object to
be raised in price, and above all it must act upon a limited
amount which is not fed from any new source of supply.
A corner on the precious metals is not to be made effective
even by a combination of all civilized nations. In my
opinion there is a grand fallacy in the notion that a coinage
union would do what France did, only on a larger scale.
Wolowski saw France, lying between Germany, a silver
nation, and England, a gold nation, carry out the compensatory
operation, and he inferred that all nations could
agree to do the same, more widely, more easily, and with
wider distribution of the loss. It seems to me that there
was an action and reaction here between members of the
group of nations which one can easily understand, but that
if all nations joined in the system, the alternation would
not work at all for want of a point of reaction. If all nations
agreed to join the corner on the falling metal, they
could not all bring their new demand to bear on the new
supply at the same time. As the mines are limited and
local, a new supply would touch the market only at one
point. Hence the coinage union implies no aggregation of
force at all. Make the union embrace the whole world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
and the effect is just the same as if there were none at
all, the matter standing simply on the natural laws for
the distribution of the precious metals. Control of demand
by a corner or of supply by a monopoly acts more efficiently
the smaller and closer the market is, and, conversely, the
larger and wider the transaction, the less the efficiency.
Furthermore, a corner to succeed must make sure that
there is no source of supply, and that it has to deal only
with an amount which can be computed. The gold corner
on Black Friday, 1869, was ruined when the Secretary of
the Treasury ordered sales of gold. A monopoly in like
manner, must be able to count on steady and uniform demand.
The coal combination failed when the hard times
suddenly contracted the demand for coal. Hence the
movement towards a wider market, embracing a larger
quantity, is always a movement towards less, and not
towards greater control by artificial expedients.</p>

<p>Applying these observations to the matter before us, I
have to say (1) that I consider the inference that a coinage
union would do what France did under the double standard,
only more surely and efficiently, quite mistaken; (2) as to
the alternate standard, I do not believe that the alternation
would work on a worldwide scale at all. I regard its
operation in France as fully accounted for by the relations
of the three countries, England, France, and Germany;
(3) as to bimetallism, the coinage union, instead of gaining
more stringent control to counteract and nullify the effect
of changes in supply of either metal, would have less effect
in that direction the larger it was.</p>

<p>Having thus examined the nature of artificial interferences
with value, and their limitations, I return to my
proposition that to establish a concurrent circulation is
just as impossible as to square the circle or to invent perpetual
motion. No doubt it is difficult, perhaps impossible,
to make a demonstration of a negative proposition like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
this. The burden of proof lies upon those who bring forward
attempts to solve the problem, and I can justly be
held only to examine and refute such attempts. No proof
has ever been offered by any of the persons in question.
No one of them has attempted as much of an analysis of
the effect of artificial expedients on value as the one I
have just offered. No one of them has attempted to analyze
the operation of the proposed coinage union, to show
how or why they expect it to act as they say. They pass
over this assumption as lightly as our popular advocates
of silver assume that re-monetization would put an end to
the hard times. They content themselves with analogies,
or with loose and general guesses that such and such things
would result from a coinage union. We all know what
dangers lurk in the argument from analogy. The further
you follow it the further you are from the point. An analogy
has no proper use save to set in clearer light an opinion
or a proposition which must rest for its merits on an
appropriate demonstration. Thus the attempt has been
made to illustrate the power of governments to control
the fluctuations of the metals by the analogy of a man
driving two horses. It is said that this is “controlling
natural forces for definite results,” and it is asked, “if one
man in his sphere can do this, why may not the collective
might of the nation do this in its sphere?” My answer is
that it is in the sphere of man to tame horses, but it is not
in the sphere of nations to control value, and therefore
the analogy is radically false. I cannot be held to argue
both sides of the question. I am not bound to put all the
cases of the adversaries into proper shape for discussion
and then to refute them. I plant myself squarely upon
the fundamental principles of the science of which I am a
student and deny that any concurrent circulation is possible
except under temporary and accidental circumstances, because
it involves the proposition that legislation can control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
value to bring about desired results. A concurrent circulation
must mean one which is concurrent, and if it is to
offer debtors the whole mass of both metals to pay their
debts with, it must be permanent. If both metals should be
used for a time until prices and contracts were adjusted to
them, and then one should rise so much as to go out of use,
the consequences would be disastrous to debtors beyond
anything now apprehended.</p>

<p>I proceed then to criticize the notions of a concurrent
circulation, as to their common features. The error with
them all is that they try to corner commodities the supply
of which is beyond their control or knowledge. That is a
fatal error in any corner, as I have already shown. If it
were proposed that each nation should have a certain
amount of circulation, composed of the two metals in equal
parts, and then that the circulation should be closed, then
the corner might work and there would be some sense in
it. Suppose that a nation had two hundred millions of
fixed circulation, half gold and half silver, and that this
sum was not in excess of its requirement for money. Then
I do not see how either half of the coinage should fall relatively
to the other; but if silver did fall, every dollar of silver
which was sought would involve the relinquishment of a
dollar in gold and this exchange would act on equal and
limited amounts of each metal. It would then depress
one metal and raise the other to an exactly equal degree.
The balance might, in that case, be retained. The hypothesis
of a closed circulation is, however, preposterous.
No one thinks of it.</p>

<p>The plan of a concurrent circulation with a free mint
strikes, upon close examination, at every step, against difficulties
of that sort which warn a scientific man that he is
dealing with an empirical and impossible delusion. How is
it to be brought about? The movement towards a bimetallic
circulation would never begin unless the ratio of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
coinage was the market ratio. It would not go on unless
the mint ratio followed every fluctuation of the market.
It would not be accomplished unless the mint ratio at last
was that of the market. It would not remain unless the
market ratio remained fixed. But the mint ratio cannot
be changed from time to time. If it were, the result would
be inextricable confusion in the coins, driving us back to the
use of scales and weights with which to treat the coins as
bullion.</p>

<p>If we pass over this difficulty, and suppose, for the sake
of argument, that the system had been brought into activity,
the reasons why it could not stand present themselves
in numbers. They all come back to this, that the supply is
beyond our knowledge and control. If the supply of either
metal increased, it would overthrow the legal rating at the
point at which it was put into the market, and would
destroy the equality there. Its effects would spread according
to the amount of the new supply and the length of
time it continued. The bimetallists seem to forget that an
increased demand counteracts an increased supply only by
absorbing it under a price fluctuation. The same error is
familiar in the plans for perpetual motion. Speculations
to that end often overlook the fact that we cannot employ
a force in mechanics without providing an escapement
which is always exhausting the force at our disposal. So
the bimetallists seem to think of their enhanced demand
as acting on value without an actual action and reaction
which consist in absorbing supply under a price fluctuation.
The new metal would therefore pass into the circulation
and would destroy the equilibrium of the metals in
the coinage. If this new addition were only a mathematical
increment it would suffice to establish the principle
for which I contend and to overthrow the bimetallic
theory, for if I see that any force has a certain effect I must
infer that the same force increased or continued would go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
on to greater effects; and if the final effect is not reached
it is because the force is not sufficient, not because there is
an act of the legislature in the way. If then, silver entered
the circulation, gold would leave it and be exported, if the
exchanges allowed of any export, or would be hoarded and
melted. The silver-producing countries would therefore
gravitate towards a silver circulation only, and other countries
towards a gold circulation.</p>

<p>Here another assumption of the bimetallists is involved.
They assume that the metal to be exported would be the
one which falls. Thus, if all nations had a bimetallic circulation,
and if the supply of silver in the United States
increased, it would be necessary that this silver should be
proportionately distributed among all the nations in order
to keep up the bimetallic system. No bimetallist has ever
faced this question. They assume that Americans would
pay their foreign debts with silver in that case, and they
rely on the international legal tender law to secure this.
This is one of the fallacies of legal tender referred to at
the outset. Rates of exchange and prices would at once
vary to counteract any such operation, just as they always
counteract the injustice of a forced circulation and throw
it back on those who try to perpetrate it. It may suffice
to put the case this way. If we had both metals circulating
together so that a merchant obtained both in substantially
equal proportions, and if silver should fall ever so little in
our markets, owing to increased production, and if a foreigner
were selling his products here, intending to carry home his
returns in metal, which metal would he retain to carry
away? Obviously that one which at the time and prospectively
had the higher value. Rates of exchange and prices
would adjust themselves so as to bring about the same
result through the mechanism of finance. This is one of
the most subtle questions involved in the general issue,
but it is vital to the bimetallic theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>Some writers have satisfied themselves with general
opinions—guesses, I am obliged to call them—that if the
fluctuations were kept within certain limits the concurrent
circulation would stand. They probably rely on an element
analogous to friction which unquestionably acts in
economy and finance. This element consists of habit, prejudice,
passion, dislike of trouble. It acts with great force
in retail trade, and in individual cases, and in small transactions.
Its force diminishes as we go upwards towards the
largest transactions, where the smallest percentages give
very appreciable sums. It seems to me that the bimetallic
system reduces this friction to a minimum. If a man has
to spend a dollar he does not go to a broker to buy a trade
dollar with a greenback dollar, and save a cent or two, but
if he has both a gold dollar and a silver dollar in his pocket
(and, under the bimetallic system, the chances are that
when he has two dollars he will have one of each), it needs
only the lightest shade of difference in value to determine
him which to give and which to hold. A bank of issue,
holding equal amounts of the two metals with which to
redeem its notes, would find an appreciable profit in giving
one and holding the other, and it would require nothing
but a word of command to the proper officer, involving no
risk at all. Hence I say this friction would be reduced to
its minimum under the bimetallic system. It is astonishing
what light margins of profit suffice to produce financial
movements nowadays; and the tendency is to make the
movements turn on smaller and smaller margins. Five
in the thousand above par carries gold out of this country.
Four in the thousand carries it from England to France.
When the French suspended specie payments a depreciation
of two in the thousand on the paper sufficed to throw gold
out of circulation. A variation in the ratio of metals from
15.5:1 to 15.6:1 is a variation of six and one-half in the
thousand. I do not see how small a variation must be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
order to justify any one in saying that a bimetallic circulation
could exist in spite of it. Therefore it seems to me
that the more accurately the bimetallic system was established
the more delicate and more easily overthrown it
would be, while if it was not accurately established it
would not come about at all. I submit that such a result
is one of the notes of an absurdity in any science.</p>

<p>An analogy has been suggested in illustration and support
of the bimetallic theory that two vessels of water
connected by a tube tend to preserve a level. I have already
indicated my suspicion of all analogies, but I will
alter this one to make it fit my idea of bimetallism. Suppose
two vessels capable of expansion and contraction to
a considerable degree, under the operation of forces which
act entirely independently of each other, so that the variations
in shape and capacity of each may have all conceivable
relations to the corresponding variations of the other.
Suppose further that each is fed by a stream of water, each
stream being variable in its flow and the variations of each
having all possible relations to the variations of the other.
The fluctuations in capacity may represent fluctuations of
demand, and the fluctuations of inflow, fluctuations of
supply. Would the water in the two vessels stand at the
same level except temporarily and accidentally, even
though the two vessels were connected by a tube? The
analogy of the connecting tube could not be admitted even
then, because it brings into play the natural law of the
equilibrium of fluids, to which the legal tie between the
metals is not analogous. If we desire to make the analogy
approximately just, in this respect, we may suppose that
each vessel has an outlet and that a man is stationed to
open the outlet of the vessel in which the water is at the
higher point so as to try to keep them both at a level. It
is evident that his utmost vigilance would be unavailing to
secure the object proposed. I do not borrow the analogy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
or adopt it. I only show how inadequate it is, in the form
proposed.</p>

<p>There is another group of propositions which have many
advocates amongst us, of which something ought to be
said—propositions of those who want to use silver as a legal
tender at its value, under some scheme or other. Some
want a public declaration, by appointed persons, from time
to time, of the market value. Any such plan would throw
on the officers in question a responsibility which would be
onerous in the extreme, so much so that no one could or
would discharge it; and it would introduce a mischievous
element of speculation into the payment of all debts. It
is, besides, open to the objections which may be adduced
against the other plan, which is to have either coins or bars
of silver, assayed and stamped, legal tender for debts at
the market quotation. Here we need to remember the
definition of legal tender given at the outset. If these silver
coins and bars are convenient for the purpose they will
come into use by custom and consent at their value. If
they really pass at their market value, there will be no advantage
to the debtor. One who has silver and wants to
pay a debt can do so at its value by selling the silver. In
this sense every man who produces wheat, cotton, iron, or
personal services, pays his debts with them at their value.
One who produced something else than silver would have no
object in selling it for silver, to pay his debt with at the value
of silver. He would have the trouble of another transaction,
he would have to buy silver at its selling price, and the
creditor to whom he paid it would have to sell it for money
at the broker’s buying price, with no advantage to either,
but only to the broker. If silver passes at its value, legal
tender has no force for it; if it is to have forced circulation
in some way, it will help the debtor, as all forced circulation
does, by enabling him to keep part of what he borrowed.
If then these schemes really mean that silver shall pass at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
its value, they are of no use. It does so now. If they mean
that silver shall be enabled to pay debts in some other way
than iron, wheat, cotton, etc., then we know what we are
dealing with. There is just as much reason why the government
should pay for elevators and issue certificates of
the amount and quality of grain, which should be legal
tender, as there is why it should assay and stamp silver for
that purpose, and issue notes for it. These cases only serve
to bring out the distinction between money and merchandise,
and to show that the perfection of money does not lie
in the direction of a multiple legal tender, but of a single
standard, as sharp and definite as possible. Such a standard
has the same advantages in exchange as the most accurate
measures of length and weight have in surveying or
in chemistry, and it is turning backward the progress of
monetary science to introduce fluctuations and doubt into
the standard of value, just as it would be to cultivate inaccuracy
in weights and measures.</p>

<p>Here I am forced to notice another hasty and mischievous
analogy. Some devices for composite measures of length
have been adopted to avoid contraction and expansion,
and it is urged that bimetallic money is a step in the same
direction. I by no means assert that science can do
nothing to reach a better standard of value than gold is.
What progress in that direction may lie in the future no
one can tell, and he would be rash who should ever presume
to deny that progress can be made; but when any proposition
is presented it will have to show what composite measures
of length show, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, that its action is founded on natural
laws. Heat and cold act oppositely on the components
of the composite measures of length, or the arrangement
is such that the action of the natural forces neutralizes.
No such scientific principle underlies bimetallic money.
The forces determining the value of gold and silver
act independently of each other and are not subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
to common influences. They are complex, moreover, and
their effects are not uniform in their different degrees.
Therefore this analogy also fails.</p>

<p>The opinion that a concurrent circulation is not possible
has led several of the leading nations of Europe (and, at
the time of writing such is still the system of the United
States) to adopt the plan of a permanently false rating of
gold and silver, so as to use silver as a subsidiary coinage.
Silver is permanently overrated, so that it obtains currency
above its bullion value. If the civilized nations want to
use silver for money, so that the total amount of metallic
money in the Western world shall be greater than the
amount of gold, and if they are not satisfied with the use
of it as subsidiary, then there is only one way left, and that
is for some nations to use gold and some to use silver. This
was the solution of the bimetallic difficulty which China
was forced to adopt a thousand years ago. Some provinces
used iron and some copper. The question then arises
as to who will take silver. This brings me to the last
point of which I have to speak.</p>

<p>I have discussed my subject as if gold and silver stood
on the same level of desirability for money, and as if there
were no choice of convenience between them. Such is not
the case in fact. It will be observed that gold and silver
never have been used together. Gold has generally been
subsidiary, being employed for large transactions. With the
advance of prices and the increase in variety of commodities,
as well as in the magnitude of transactions, nations
have passed from copper money to silver and from silver
to gold. This advance is dictated by convenience. Silver
is no longer as convenient a money for civilized industrial
and commercial nations as gold. We therefore see them
gradually abandoning silver, and we saw the Latin Union
set up a bar against silver so soon as the operation of the
double legal tender threatened to take away gold and give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
it silver. Whether this movement from silver to gold
can be accomplished without financial convulsions I am
not prepared to say, especially in view of the extent to
which the nations have depreciated gold by paper issues,
but I regard the movement as one which must inevitably
go forward. The nations which step into the movement
first will lose least on the silver they have to sell. The
nations which use silver until the last will lose most upon
it, because they will find no one to take it off their hands.
If we now abandon the gold standard and buy the cast-off
silver of the nations which have been using it and are
now anxious to get rid of it, we voluntarily subject ourselves
to that loss, which we are in no respect called upon
to share. The Dutch at New York kept up the use of
wampum longer than the English in New England. When
the Yankees were trying to get rid of it, they carried it
to New York, adding some which they manufactured for
the purpose, and they carried the goods of the Dutchmen
away. The latter then found that they held a currency
which they could only get rid of at great loss and delay to
the Indians north and west of them. The Yankees thus
early earned a reputation for smartness. The measure
now proposed is a complete parallel, only that now this
nation proposes to take the rôle of the Dutch. We shall
have to give our capital for silver, and after we have
suffered from years of experience with a tool of exchange
inferior to that which our neighbors are using, we shall
have to get rid of it and buy the best. Then we shall
incur the loss—to all those who have anything—of the difference
between the capital we gave and that which we
can get for the silver. The dreams of getting silver and
keeping gold too, so as to have a concurrent circulation, are
all vain. At the rating proposed there is no difference of
opinion on this point amongst any persons at all qualified
to give an opinion. The real significance of the propositions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
before the country is to make us one of the nations
to take silver in the distribution I have described. The
notion of a coinage union is impracticable. It would be
easier to get up an international union to do away with
war. England is perfectly satisfied with her money. She
appreciates the peril of monetary experiments and will
make none. Germany, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and
Holland have just changed from silver to gold, and will
not enter on any new changes for a long period, if ever.
The coinage union is therefore out of the question. The
issue before us is simply whether we, being a gold
nation, will, under these circumstances, abandon gold and
take up silver. No doubt the nations which want gold
would be very glad to have us do it. We should render
them a great service; we should, however, do ourselves
great harm, as much so as if we should buy a lot of cast-off
machinery from them. They are waiting to see whether
we are ignorant and foolish enough to put ourselves in this
position; and when they have seen, we shall hear no more
of the coinage union.</p>

<p>I have now presented the views to which my study of
this question has led me. It will be perceived that I direct
my attack against the postulate of all the bimetallic theories.
I have carefully discriminated between the alternate
standard and bimetallism. I have said little about the
former. It is very much a matter of opinion whether it
would work or not. I do not believe that it would, under a
coinage union, but I should not feel forced to take strong
ground against any one who held the contrary opinion.
My subject has been a concurrent circulation of gold and
silver, and I have tried to controvert the notion that any
such thing is possible, with or without a coinage union,
because that notion contradicts the first great law of economic
science. If that notion is true, then there is no
science of political economy at all; there are no laws to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
be found out, a professional economist has nothing to
teach, and he might better try to find some useful occupation.
If that notion is true, we have no ground on which
to criticize the Congressmen who are trying to pass the
silver bill. We cannot predict any consequences or draw
any inferences from past experience. If legislation can
control value for definite results, then the whole matter is
purely empirical. In that case, the Congressional experiment
may turn out well for all the grounds we have to
assert the contrary; its success would only be questionable,
not impossible; if it failed it would not be because its
supporters had attempted the impossible, but because they
had not used sufficient means. They could go on to try
the experiment again and again in other forms and with
other means, and they would indeed be doing right to
proceed with their experiments, like the old alchemists,
in the hope of hitting it at last. No economist would
have any ground upon which to step in and define the
limits of the possible, or to prescribe the conditions of
success, or to set forth the methods which must be pursued—if
he could not appeal with confidence to the laws
of his science as something to which legislature as well
as individuals must bend. Therefore one who holds the
views I have expressed in regard to economic forces,
laws, and phenomena is compelled, as well by his faith
in his science as by the public interests now at stake in
the question, to maintain that a concurrent circulation
of gold and silver, either with or without a coinage union,
is impossible.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Any one</span> who follows the current literature about
economic subjects will perceive that it is so full of
contradictions as to create a doubt whether there are any
economic laws, or whether, if there are any, we know anything
about them. No body of men ever succeeded in
molding the opinions of others by wrangling with each
other, and that is the present attitude in which the economists
present themselves before the public. Like other
people who engage in wrangling, the economists have also
allowed their method to degenerate from argument to
abuse, contempt, and sneering disparagement of each
other. The more superficial and self-sufficient the opinions
and behavior of the disputants, the more absolutely they
abandon sober arguments and devote themselves to the
method I have described. As I have little taste for this
kind of discussion and believe that it only degrades the
science of which I am a student, I have taken no part in it.
In answer to your invitation, now, what I propose to do
is to call your attention to some features of the economic
situation of civilized nations at the present time with a
view to establish two points:</p>

<p>1. To explain the vacillation and feebleness of opinions
about economic doctrine which mark the present time, and</p>

<p>2. To show the necessity, just at this time, of calm and
sober apprehension of sound doctrine in political economy.</p>

<p>At the outset let me ask you to notice the effects which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
have been produced during the last century by the developments
of science and of the industrial arts. Formerly,
industry was pursued on a small scale, with little or no
organization. Markets were limited to small districts, and
commerce was confined to raw materials and colonial products.
Producer and consumer met face to face. The conditions
of the market were open to personal inspection.
The relations of supply and demand were matters of personal
experience. Production was carried on for orders
only in many branches of industry, so that supply and
demand were fitted to one another, as we may say, physically.
Disproportionate production was, therefore, prevented
and the necessity of redistributing productive
effort was made plain by the most direct personal experience.
Under such a state of things, much time must elapse
between the formation of a wish and its realization.</p>

<p>Within a century very many and various forces have
been at work to produce an entire change in this system
of industry. The invention of the steam engine and of the
machines used in the textile fabrics produced the factory
system, with a high organization of industry, concentrated
at certain centers. The opening of canals and the improvement
of highways made possible the commerce by which
the products were distributed. The cheapening of printing
and the multiplication of means of advertising widened the
market by concentrating the demand which was widely
dispersed in place, until now the market is the civilized
world. The applications of steam power to roads and ships
only extended further the same development, and the telegraph
has only cheapened and accelerated the means of
communicating information to the same end.</p>

<p>What have been the effects on industry?</p>

<p>1. The whole industry and commerce of the world have
been built up into a great system in which organization
has become essential and in which it has been carried forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
and is being carried forward every day to new developments.
Industry has been growing more and more impersonal as far
as the parties to it are concerned. Our wants are satisfied
instantaneously and regularly by the coöperation of thousands
of people all over the world whom we have never seen
or heard of; and we earn our living daily by contributing to
satisfy the wants of thousands scattered all over the world,
of whom we know nothing personally. In the place of
actual contact and acquaintance with the persons who are
parties to the transactions, we now depend upon the regularity,
under the conditions of earthly life, of human wants
and human efforts. The system of industry is built upon
the constancy of certain conditions of human existence,
upon the certainty of the economic forces which thence
arise, and upon the fact that those forces act with perfect
regularity under changeless laws. If we but reflect a moment,
we shall see that modern industry and commerce
could not go on for a day if we were not dealing here with
forces and laws which may properly be called natural because
they come into action when the conditions are fulfilled,
because the conditions cannot but exist if there is a
society of human beings collected anywhere on earth, and
because, when the forces come into action, they work themselves
out, according to their laws, without possible escape
from their effects. We can divert the forces from one
course to another; we can change their form; we can
make them expend themselves upon one person or interest
instead of upon another. We do this all the time, by bad
legislation, by prejudice, habit, fashion, erroneous notions
of equity, happiness, the highest good, and so on; but we
never destroy an economic force any more than we destroy
a physical force.</p>

<p>2. Of course it follows that success in the production
of wealth under this modern system depends primarily on
the correctness with which men learn the character of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
economic forces and of the laws under which those forces act.
This is the field of the science of political economy, and it
is the reason why it is a science. It investigates the laws
of forces which are natural, not arbitrary, artificial, or conventional.
Some communities have developed a great
hatred for persons who held different religious opinions
from themselves. Such a feeling would be a great social
force, but it would be arbitrary and artificial. Many communities
have held that all labor, not mental, was slavish
and degrading. This notion, too, was conventional, but
it was a great social force where it existed. Such notions,
either past or present, are worth studying for historical
interest and instruction, but they do not afford the basis
for a science whose object is to find out what is true in
regard to the relations of man to the world in which he
lives. The study of them throws a valuable sidelight on
the true relations of human life, just as the study of error
always throws a sidelight upon the truth, but they have
no similarity to the law that men want the maximum of
satisfaction for the minimum of effort, or to the law of the
diminishing return from land, or to the law of population,
or to the law of supply and demand. Nothing can be
gained, therefore, by mixing up history and science, valuable
as one is to the other. If men try to carry on any
operation without an intelligent theory of the forces with
which they are dealing, they inevitably become the victims
of the operation, not its masters. Hence they always
do try to form some theory of the forces in question and
to plan the means to the end accordingly. The forces of
nature go on and are true only to themselves. They never
swerve out of pity for innocent error or well-intentioned
mistakes. This is as true of economic forces as of any
others. What is meant by a good or a bad investment,
except that one is based on a correct judgment of forces
and the other on incorrect judgment? How would sagacity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
care, good judgment, and prudence meet their reward if
the economic forces swerved out of pity for error? We
know that there is no such thing in the order of nature.</p>

<p>I repeat, then, that the modern industrial and commercial
system, dealing as it does with vast movements which
no one mind can follow or compass in their ramifications
and which are kept in harmony by natural laws, demands
steadily advancing, clear, and precise knowledge of economic
laws; that this knowledge must banish prejudices
and traditions; that it must conquer baseless enthusiasms
and whimsical hopes. If it does not accomplish this, we
can expect but one result—that men will chase all sorts
of phantoms and impossible hopes; that they will waste
their efforts upon schemes which can only bring loss; and
that some will run one way and some another until society
loses all coherence, all unanimity of judgment as to what
is to be sought and how to attain to it. The destruction
of capital is only the least of the evils to be apprehended
in such a case. I do not believe that we begin to appreciate
one effect of the new civilization of the nineteenth century,
<abbr>viz.</abbr>, that the civilized world of to-day is a unit, that it
must move as a whole, that with the means we have devised
of a common consent in regard to the ends of human
life and the means of attaining them has come also the
<em>necessity</em> that we should move onward in civilization by a
common consent. The barriers of race, religion, language,
and nationality are melting away under the operation of
the same forces which have to such an extent annihilated
the obstacles of distance and time. Civilization is constantly
becoming more uniform. The conquests of some
become at once the possession of all. It follows that our
scientific knowledge of the laws which govern the life of
men in society must keep pace with this development or
we shall find our social tasks grow faster than our knowledge
of social science, and our society will break to pieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
under the burden. How, then, is this scientific knowledge
to grow? Certainly not without controversy, but certainly
also not without coherent, steady, and persistent effort,
proceeding on the lines already cut, breaking new ground
when possible, correcting old errors when necessary.</p>

<p>3. It is another feature of the modern industrial system
that, like every high organization, it requires men of suitable
ability and skill at its head. The qualities which are
required for a great banker, merchant, or manufacturer are
as rare as any other great gifts among men, and the qualities
demanded, or the degree in which they are demanded,
are increasing every day with the expansion of the modern
industrial system. The qualities required are those of the
practical man, properly so called: sagacity, good judgment,
prudence, boldness, and energy. The training, both
scientific and practical, which is required for a great master
of industry is wide and various. The great movements of
industry, like all other great movements, present subordinate
phenomena which are apparently opposed to, or inconsistent
with their great tendencies and their general
character. These phenomena, being smaller in scope, more
directly subject to observation and therefore apparently
more distinct and positive, are well calculated to mislead
the judgment, either of the practical man or of the scientific
student. In nothing, therefore, does the well-trained man
distinguish himself from the ill-trained man more than in
the balance of judgment by which he puts phenomena in
their true relative position and refuses to be led astray by
what is incidental or subsidiary. If, now, the question is
asked, whether we have produced a class of highly trained
men, competent to organize labor, transportation, commerce,
and banking, on the scale required by the modern
system, as rapidly as the need for them has increased, I
believe no one will answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>4. Another observation to which we are led upon noticing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
the character of the modern industrial system is that
any errors or follies committed in one portion of it will
produce effects which will ramify through the whole system.
We have here an industrial organism, not a mere
mechanical combination, and any disturbance in one part
of it will derange or vitiate, more or less, the whole. The
phenomena which here appear belong to what has been
called fructifying causation. One economic error produces
fruits which combine with those of another economic error,
and the product of the two is not their sum, nor even their
simple product, but the evil may be raised to a very high
power by the combination. If a number of errors fall together
the mischief is increased accordingly. Currency and
tariff errors constantly react upon each other, and multiply
and develop each other in this way. Furthermore, the
errors of one nation will be felt in other nations through
the relations of commerce and credit which are now so
close. There is no limit to the interest which civilized
nations have in each other’s economic and political wisdom,
for they all bear the consequences of each other’s follies.
Hence when we have to deal with that form of economic
disease which we call a commercial crisis, we may trace
its origin to special errors in one country and in another,
and may trace out the actions and reactions by which the
effects have been communicated from one to another until
shared by all; but no philosophy of a great commercial
crisis is adequate nowadays unless it embraces in its scope
the whole civilized world. A commercial crisis is a disturbance
in the harmonious operation of the parts of the industrial
organism. During economic health, the system
moves smoothly and harmoniously, expanding continually,
and its health and vigor are denoted by its growth, that is,
by the accumulation of capital, which stimulates in its
turn the hope, energy, and enterprise of men. Industrial
disease is produced by disproportionate production, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
wrong distribution of labor, erroneous judgment in enterprise,
or miscalculations of force. These all have the same
effect, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, to waste and destroy capital. Such causes
disturb, in a greater or less degree, the harmonious working
of the system, which depends upon the regular and exact
fulfillment of the expectations which have been based on
coöperative effort throughout the whole industrial body.
The disturbance may be slight and temporary, or it may
be very serious. In the latter case it will be necessary to
arrest the movement of the whole system and to proceed
to a general liquidation, before starting again. Such was
the case from 1837 to 1842, and such has been the case for
the last five years. It is needless to add that this arrest
and liquidation cannot be accomplished without distress
and loss to great numbers of innocent persons, and great
positive loss of capital, to say nothing of what might have
been won during the same period but must be foregone.</p>

<p>The financial organization is the medium by which the
various parts of the industrial and commercial organism
are held in harmony. It is by the financial organization
that capital is collected and distributed, that the friction
of exchanges is reduced to a minimum, and that time is
economized, through credit, between production and consumption.
The financial system furnishes three indicators—prices,
the rate of discount, and the foreign exchanges—through
which we may read the operation of economic
forces now that their magnitude makes it impossible to
inspect them directly. Hence the great mischief of usury
laws which tamper with the rate of discount, and of fluctuating
currencies which falsify prices and the foreign
exchanges. They destroy the value of the indicators, and
have the same effect as tampering with the scales of a
chemist or the steam-gauge of a locomotive.</p>

<p>In the matter of prices we have another difficulty to
contend with, which is inevitable in the nature of things.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
We must choose some commodity to be the denominator
of value. We can find no commodity which is not itself
subject to fluctuation in its ratio of exchange with other
things. Great crises have been caused in past times by
fluctuations in the value of the commodities chosen as
money, and such an element is, no doubt, at hand in the
present crisis, although it had nothing to do with bringing
it about. It follows that any improvement in the world’s
money is worth any sacrifice which it can possibly cost, if
it tends to secure a more simple, exact, and unchanging
standard of value.</p>

<p>The next point of which I wish to speak is easily introduced
by the last remark; that point is the cost of all improvement.
The human race has made no step whatever in
civilization which has not been won by pain and distress.
It wins no steps now without paying for them in sacrifices.
To notice only things which are directly pertinent to our
present purpose: every service which we win from nature
displaces the acquired skill of the men who formerly performed
the service; every such step is a gain to the race,
but it imposes on some men the necessity of finding new
means of livelihood, and if those men are advanced in
life, this necessity may be harsh in the extreme. Every
new machine, although it saves labor, and because it saves
labor, serves the human race, yet destroys a vested
interest of some laborers in the work which it performs.
It imposes on them the necessity of turning to a new occupation,
and this is hardly ever possible without a period of
distress. It very probably throws them down from the
rank of skilled to that of unskilled labor. Every new machine
also destroys capital. It makes useless the half-worn-out
machines which it supersedes. So canals caused
capital which was invested in turnpikes and state coaches
to depreciate, and so railroads have caused the capital
invested in canals and other forms to depreciate. I see no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
exception to the rule that the progress won by the race
is always won at the expense of some group of its members.</p>

<p>Any one who will look back upon the last twenty-five
years cannot fail to notice that the changes, advances, and
improvements have been numerous and various. We are
accustomed to congratulate each other upon them. There
can be no doubt that they must and will contribute to the
welfare of the human race beyond what any one can now
possibly foresee or measure. I am firmly convinced, for
my opinion, that the conditions of wealth and civilization
for the next quarter of a century are provided for in excess
of any previous period of history, and that nothing but
human folly can prevent a period of prosperity which we,
even now, should regard as fabulous. We can throw it
away if we are too timid, if we become frightened at the
rate of our own speed, or if we mistake the phenomena of
a new era for the approach of calamity, or if the nations
turn back to mediæval darkness and isolation, or if we
elevate the follies and ignorances of the past into elements
of economic truth, or if, instead of pursuing liberty with
full faith and hope, the civilized world becomes the arena
of a great war of classes in which all civilization must be
destroyed. But, such follies apart, the conditions of prosperity
are all provided.</p>

<p>We must notice, however, that these innovations have
fallen with great rapidity upon a vast range of industries,
that they have accumulated their effects, that they have
suddenly altered the currents of trade and the methods of
industry, and that we have hardly learned to accommodate
ourselves to one new set of circumstances before a newer
change or modification has been imposed. Some inventions,
of which the Bessemer steel is the most remarkable
example, have revolutionized industries. Some new channels
of commerce have been opened which have changed
the character and methods of very important branches of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
commerce. We have also seen a movement of several
nations to secure a gold currency, which movement fell
in with a large if not extraordinary production of silver
and altered the comparative demand and supply of the
two metals at the same time. This movement had nothing
arbitrary about it, but proceeded from sound motives and
reasons in the interest of the nations which took this step.
There is here no ground for condemnation or approval.
Such action by sovereign nations is taken under liberty
and responsibility to themselves alone, and if it is taken
on a sufficiently large scale to form an event of importance
to the civilized world, it must be regarded as a step in
civilization. It can only be criticized by history. For the
present, it is to be accepted and interpreted only as an
indication that there are reasons and motives of self-interest
which can lead a large part of the civilized world to this
step at this time.</p>

<p>The last twenty-five years have also included political
events which have had great effects on industry. Our Civil
War caused an immense destruction of capital and left a
large territory with millions of inhabitants almost entirely
ruined in its industry, and with its labor system exposed to
the necessity of an entire re-formation. Part of the expenditures
and losses of the war were postponed and distributed
by means of the paper currency which, instead of imposing
industry and economy to restore the losses and waste,
created the foolish belief that we could make war and get
rich by it. The patriotic willingness of the nation to be
taxed was abused to impose taxes for protection, not for
revenue, so that the industry of the country was distorted
and forced into unnatural development. The collapse of
1873, followed by a fall in prices and a general liquidation,
was due to the fact that every one knew in his heart that
the state of things which had existed for some years before
was hollow and fictitious. Confidence failed because every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
one knew that there were no real grounds for confidence.
The Franco-Prussian war had, also, while it lasted, produced
a period of false and feverish prosperity in England.
It was succeeded by great political changes in Germany
which, together with the war indemnity, led to a sudden
and unfounded expansion of speculation, amounting to a
mania. Germany undoubtedly stands face to face with a
new political and industrial future, but she has postponed
it by a headlong effort to realize it at once. In France, too,
the war was followed by a hasty, and, as we are told, unwise
extension of permanent capital, planned to meet the extraordinary
demand of an empty market. In England the
prosperity of 1870–1872 has been followed as usual by developments
of unsound credit, bad banking, and needless
investments in worthless securities.</p>

<p>Here then we have, in a brief and inadequate statement,
circumstances in all these great industrial nations peculiar
to each, yet certainly sufficient to account for a period of
reaction and distress. We have also before us great features
of change in the world’s industry and commerce
which must ultimately produce immeasurable advantages,
but which may well, operating with local causes, produce
temporary difficulty; and we have to notice also that the
local causes react through the commercial and credit relations
of nations to distribute the evil.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, under such a state of things, that
some people should lose their heads and begin to doubt the
economic doctrines which have been most thoroughly established.
It belongs to the symptoms of disease to lose
confidence in the laws of health and to have recourse to
quack remedies. I have already observed that certain
phenomena appear in every great social movement which
are calculated to deceive by apparent inconsistency or
divergence. Hence we have seen the economists, instead
of holding together and sustaining, at the time when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
was most needed, both the scientific authority and the
positive truth of their doctrines, break up and run hither
and thither, some of them running away altogether. Many
of them seem to be terrified to find that distress and misery
still remain on earth and promise to remain as long as the
vices of human nature remain. Many of them are frightened
at liberty, especially under the form of competition,
which they elevate into a bugbear. They think that it
bears harshly on the weak. They do not perceive that
here “the strong” and “the weak” are terms which admit
of no definition unless they are made equivalent to the
industrious and the idle, the frugal and the extravagant.
They do not perceive, furthermore, that if we do not like
the survival of the fittest, we have only one possible alternative,
and that is the survival of the unfittest. The former
is the law of civilization; the latter is the law of anti-civilization.
We have our choice between the two, or we
can go on, as in the past, vacillating between the two, but
a third plan—the socialist desideratum—a plan for
nourishing the unfittest and yet advancing in civilization,
no man will ever find. Some of the crude notions, however,
which have been put forward surpass what might reasonably
have been expected. These have attached themselves
to branches of the subject which it is worth while to notice.</p>

<p>1. As the change in the relative value of the precious
metals is by far the most difficult and most important of
the features of this period, it is quite what we might have
expected that the ill-trained and dilettante writers should
have pounced upon it as their special prey. The dabblers
in philology never attempt anything less than the problem
of the origin of language. Every teacher knows that he
has to guard his most enthusiastic pupils against precipitate
attempts to solve the most abstruse difficulties of the
science. The change in the value of the precious metals
which is going on will no doubt figure in history as one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
the most important events in the economic history of this
century. It will undoubtedly cost much inconvenience and
loss to those who are in the way of it, or who get in the way
of it. It will, when the currency changes connected with it
are accomplished, prove a great gain to the whole commercial
world. The nations which make the change do so
because it is important for their interests to do it. Now,
suppose that it were possible for those who are frightened
at the immediate and temporary inconveniences, to arrest
the movement—the only consequence would be that they
would arrest and delay the inevitable march of improvement
in the industrial system.</p>

<p>2. The second field, which is an especial favorite with
the class of writers which I have described, is that of prognostications
as to what developments of the economic
system lie in the future. Probably every one has notions
about this and every one who has to conduct business or
make investments is forced to form judgments about it.
There is hardly a field of economic speculation, however,
which is more barren.</p>

<p>3. The third field into which these writers venture by
preference is that of remedies for existing troubles. The
popular tide of medicine is always therapeutics, and the
less one knows of anatomy and physiology the more sure
he is to address himself exclusively to this department,
and to rely upon empirical remedies. The same procedure
is followed in social science, and it is accompanied by the
same contempt for scientific doctrine and knowledge and
remedies. To bring out the points which here seem to me
important, it will be necessary to go back for a moment
to some facts which I have already described.</p>

<p>One of the chief characteristics of the great improvements
in industry, which have been described, is that they bring
about new distributions of population. If machinery displaces
laborers engaged in manufactures, these laborers are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
driven to small shopkeeping, if they have a little capital;
or to agricultural labor, if they have no capital. Improvements
in commerce will destroy a local industry and force
the laborers to find a new industry or to change their abode.
When forces of this character coöperate on a grand scale,
they may and do produce very important redistributions
of population. In like manner legislation may, as tariff
legislation does, draw population to certain places, and its
repeal may force them to unwelcome change. We may
state the fact in this way: let us suppose that, in 1850,
out of every hundred laborers in the population, the economical
distribution was such that fifty should be engaged
in agriculture, thirty in manufacturing, and the other
twenty in other pursuits. That is to say that, with the
machinery and appliances then available, thirty manufacturing
laborers could use the raw materials and food
produced by fifty agricultural laborers so as to occupy all
to the highest advantage. Now suppose that, by improvements
in the arts, twenty men could, in 1880, use to the
best advantage the raw materials and food produced by
sixty in agriculture. It is evident that a redistribution
would be necessary by which ten should be turned from
manufacturing to land. That such a change has been produced
within the last thirty years and that it has reached
a point at which is setting in the counter movement to the
former tendency from the land to the cities and towns,
seems to me certain. There are even indications of great
changes going on in the matter of distribution which will
correct the loss and waste involved in the old methods of
distribution long before any of the fancy plans for correcting
them can be realized, and which are setting free both
labor and capital in that department. Now if we can
economize labor and capital in manufacturing, transportation,
and distribution, and turn this labor and capital back
upon the soil, we must vastly increase wealth, for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
movement would enlarge the stream of wealth from its
very source.</p>

<p>Right here, however, we need to make two observations.</p>

<p>1. The modern industrial system which I have described,
with its high organization and fine division of labor, has one
great drawback. The men, or groups of men, are dissevered
from one another, their interests are often antagonistic,
and the changes which occur take the form of conflicts
of interest. I mean this: if a shoemaker worked alone,
using a small capital of his own in tools and stock, and
working for orders, he would have directly before him
the facts of the market. He would find out without effort
or reflection when “trade fell off,” when there was risk of
not replacing his capital, when the course of fashion or
competition called upon him to find other occupation, and
so on. When a journeyman shoemaker works for wages,
he pays no heed to these things. The employer, feeling
them, has no recourse but to lower wages. It is by this
measure that, under the higher organization, the need of
new energy, or of a change of industry, or of a change of
place is brought home to the workman. To him, however,
it seems an arbitrary and cruel act of the master. Hence
follow trade wars and strikes as an especial phenomenon
of the modern system. It is just because it is a system, or
more properly still, an organism, that the readjustments
which are necessary from time to time in order to keep its
parts in harmonious activity, and to keep it in harmony
with physical surroundings, are brought about through this
play of the parts on each other.</p>

<p>2. A general movement of labor and capital towards land,
throughout the civilized world, means a great migration
towards the new countries. This does not by any means
imply the abandonment or decay of older countries, as
some have seemed to believe. On the contrary, it means
new prosperity for them. When I read that the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
States are about to feed the world, not only with wheat
and provisions, but with meat also, that they are to furnish
coal and iron to mankind, that they are to displace all
the older countries as exporters of manufactures, that they
are to furnish the world’s supply of the precious metals,
and I know not what all besides, I am forced to ask what
is the rest of the world going to do for us? What are they
to give us besides tea, coffee, and sugar? Not ships, for
we will not take them and are ambitious to carry away all
our products ourselves. Certainly this is the most remarkable
absurdity into which we have been led by forgetting
that trade is an exchange. Neither can any one well expect
that all mankind are to come and live here. The conditions
of a large migration do, however, seem to exist. A
migration of population is still a very unpopular idea in
all the older states. The prejudice against it is apparent
amongst Liberals and Tories, economists and sentimentalists.
There is, however, a condition which is always
suppressed in stating the social problem as it presents itself
in hard times. That problem, as stated, is: “How are the
population to find means of support?” and the suppressed
condition is: “if they insist on staying and seeking support
where they are and in pursuits to which they are accustomed.”
The hardships of change are not for one moment
to be denied, but nothing is gained by sitting down to whine
about them. The sentimental reasons for clinging to one’s
birthplace may be allowed full weight, but they cannot be
allowed to counterbalance important advantages. I do not
see that any but land owners are interested to hold population
in certain places, unless possibly we add governing
classes and those who want military power. When I read
declamations about nationality and the importance of
national divisions to political economy (observe that I do
not say to political science), I never can find any sense in
them, and I am very sure that the writers never put any
sense into them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>We may now return to consider the remedies proposed
for hard times. We shall see that although they are quack
remedies, and although they set at defiance all the economic
doctrines which have been so laboriously established
during the last century, they are fitted to meet the difficulty
as it presents itself to land owners, governments,
military powers, socialists, and sentimentalists. The tendency
is towards an industrial system controlled by a
natural coöperation far grander than anybody has ever
planned, towards a community of interest and welfare far
more beneficent than any universal republic or fraternity
of labor which the Internationalists hope for, and towards
a free and peaceful rivalry amongst nations in the arts of
civilization. It is necessary to stop this tendency. What
are the means proposed?</p>

<p>1. The first is to put a limit to civil liberty. By civil
liberty (for I feel at once the need of defining this much-abused
word) I mean the status which is created for an
individual by those institutions which guarantee him the
use of his own powers for his own development. For three
or four centuries now, the civilized world has been struggling
towards the realization of this civil liberty. Progress
towards it has been hindered by the notion that liberty
was some vague abstraction, or an emancipation from some
of the hard conditions of human life, from which men never
can be emancipated while they live on this earth. Civil
liberty has also been confused with political activity or
share in civil government. Political activity itself, however,
is only a means to an end, and is valuable because it
is necessary to secure to the individual free exercise of his
powers to produce and exchange according to his own choice
and his own conception of happiness, and to secure him
also that the products of his labor shall be applied to his
satisfaction and not to that of any others. When we come
to understand civil liberty for what it is, we shall probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
go forward to realize it more completely. It will then
appear that it begins and ends with freedom of production,
freedom of exchange, and security of property. It will
then appear also that governments depart from their prime
and essential function when they undertake to transfer
property instead of securing it, and it may then be understood
that legal tender laws, and protective tariffs as
amongst the last and most ingenious devices for transferring
one man’s product to another man’s use, are gross violations
of civil liberty. At present the attempt is being
made to decry liberty, to magnify the blunders and errors
of men in the pursuit of happiness into facts which should
be made the basis of generalizations about the functions
of government, and to present the phenomena of the commercial
crisis as reasons for putting industry once more in
leading strings. It is only a new foe with an old face. Those
who have held the leading strings of industry in time past
have always taken rich pay for their services, and they will
do it again.</p>

<p>2. The second form of remedy proposed is quite consistent
with the last. It consists in rehabilitating the old
and decaying superstition of government. It is called
the state, and all kinds of poetical and fanciful attributes
are ascribed to it. It is presented, of course, as a superior
power, able and ready to get us out of trouble. If an individual
is in trouble, he has to help himself or secure the
help of friends as best he can, but if a group of persons are
in trouble together, they constitute a party, a power, and
begin to make themselves felt in the state. The state
has no means of helping them except by enabling them to
throw the risks and losses of their business upon other people
who already have the burdens and losses of their own
business to bear, but who are less well organized. The
“state” assumes to judge what is for the public interest and
imposes taxes or interferes with contracts to force individuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
to the course which will realize what it has set before itself.
When, however, all the fine phrases are stripped away,
it appears that the state is only a group of men with human
interests, passions, and desires, or, worse yet, the state is,
as somebody has said, only an obscure clerk hidden in some
corner of a governmental bureau. In either case the
assumption of superhuman wisdom and virtue is proved
false. The state is only a part of the organization of
society in and for itself. That organization secures certain
interests and provides for certain functions which are
important but which would otherwise be neglected. The
task of society, however, has always been and is yet, to
secure this organization, and yet to prevent the man in
whose hands public power must at last be lodged from
using it to plunder the governed—that is, to destroy liberty.
This is what despots, oligarchs, aristocrats, and democrats
always have done, and the latest development is only a
new form of the old abuse. The abuses have always been
perpetrated in the name of the public interest. It was for
the public interest to support the throne and the altar.
It was for the public interest to sustain privileged classes,
to maintain an established church, standing armies, and
the passport and police system. Now, it is for the public
interest to have certain industries carried on, and the holders
of the state power apportion their favor without rule or
reason, without responsibility, and without any return
service. In the end, therefore, the high function of the
state to regulate the industrial organization in the public
interest is simply that the governing group interferes to
make some people give the products of their labor to other
people to use and enjoy. Every one sees the evils of the
state meddling with his own business and thinks that he
ought to be let alone in it, but he sees great public interests
which would be served if the state would interfere to make
other people do what he wants to have them do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>Now if these two measures could be carried out—if
liberty could be brought into misapprehension and contempt,
and if the state-superstition could be saved from
the decay to which it is doomed, the movements of population
and the changes in industry, commerce, and finance,
could be arrested. The condemnation of all such projects
is, once and for all, that they would arrest the march of civilization.
The joy and the fears which have been aroused on
one side and on the other by the reactionary propositions
which have been made during the last five years are both
greatly exaggerated. Such reactionary propositions are in
the nature of things at such a time. It must be expected
that the pressure of distress and disappointed hopes will
produce passionate reaction and senseless outcries. From
such phenomena to actual practical measures is a long step.
Every step towards practical realization of any reactionary
measures will encounter new and multiplying obstacles.
A war of tariffs at this time would so fly in the face of all
the tendencies of commerce and industry that it would
only hasten the downfall of all tariffs. Purely retaliatory
tariffs are a case of what the children call “cutting off your
nose to spite your face.” Some follies have become physically
impossible for great nations nowadays. Germany has been
afflicted: first, by too eager hopes, second, by the great
calamity of too many and too pedantic doctors, third,
by a declining revenue, and fourth, by socialistic agitation
amongst the new electors. It appears that she is about to
abandon the free-trade policy although she does not embrace
protection with much vigor. The project already comes in
conflict with numerous and various difficulties which had
not been foreseen, and, in its execution, it must meet with
many more. The result remains to be studied. France
finds that the expiration of each treaty of commerce produces
consequences upon her industry which are unendurable,
and while the task of adjusting rival and contending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
interests so as to create a new system drags along, she is
compelled to ward off, by temporary arrangements, the
revival of the general tariff which the treaties had superseded.
In the meantime her economists, who are the most
sober and the best trained in the world, are opening a
vigorous campaign on the general issue. If England
should think of reviving protection, she would not know
what to protect. If she wanted to retaliate, she could only
tax raw materials and food. The proposition, as soon as it is
reduced to practical form, has no footing. As for ourselves
we know that our present protective system never could
have been fastened upon us if it had not been concealed
under the war legislation, and if its effects had not been
confused with those of the war. It could not last now if
the public mind could be freed from its absorption in sectional
politics, so that it would be at liberty to turn to this
subject.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me refer again to another important
subject on which I have touched in this paper—what we
call the silver question. It would, no doubt, be in the power
of civilized nations to take some steps which would alleviate
the inconveniences connected with the transition of
several important nations from a silver to a gold currency.
For one nation, which has no share in the trouble at all,
to come forward out of “magnanimity” or any other motive
to save the world from the troubles incident to this step,
is quixotic and ridiculous. It might properly leave those
who are in the trouble to deal with it amongst themselves.
Either they or all might, however, do much to modify the
effects of the change. The effort to bring about an international
union to establish a bimetallic currency at a fixed
ratio is quite another thing. It will stand in the history
of our time as the most singular folly which has gained
any important adherence. As a practical measure the
international union is simply impossible. As a scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
proposition, bimetallism is as absurd as perpetual motion.
It proposes to establish perpetual rest in the fluctuations
of value of two commodities, to do which it must extinguish
the economic forces of supply and demand of those commodities
upon which value depends. The movement of
the great commercial nations towards a single gold currency
is the most important event in the monetary history of our
time, and one which nothing can possibly arrest. It produces
temporary distress, and the means of alleviating that
distress are a proper subject of consideration; but the advantages
which will be obtained for all time to come immeasurably
surpass the present loss and inconvenience.</p>

<p>I return, then, to the propositions with which I set out.
Feebleness and vacillation in regard to economic doctrine
are natural to a period of commercial crisis, on account of
the distress, uncertainty, and disorder which then prevail in
industry and trade; but that is just the time also when
a tenacious grasp of scientific principles is of the highest
importance. The human race must go forward to meet
and conquer its problems and difficulties as they arise, to
bear the penalties of its follies, and to pay the price of its
acquisitions. To shrink from this is simply to go back
and to abandon civilization. The path forward, as far
as any human foresight can now reach, lies in a better understanding
and a better realization of liberty, under which
individuals and societies can work out their destiny, subject
only to the incorruptible laws of nature.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PHILOSOPHY_OF_STRIKES41">THE PHILOSOPHY OF STRIKES<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor smaller">41</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> progress in material comfort which has been
made during the last hundred years has not produced
content. Quite the contrary: the men of to-day are not
nearly so contented with life on earth as their ancestors
were. This observation is easily explainable by familiar
facts in human nature. If satisfaction does not reach to
the pitch of satiety, it does not produce content, but discontent;
it is therefore a stimulus to more effort, and is
essential to growth. If, however, we confine our study of
the observation which we have made to its sociological
aspects, we perceive that all which we call “progress” is
limited by the counter-movements which it creates, and
we also see the true meaning of the phenomena which have
led some to the crude and silly absurdity that progress
makes us worse off. Progress certainly does not make
people happier, unless their mental and moral growth
corresponds to the greater command of material comfort
which they win. All that we call progress is a simple enlargement
of chances, and the question of personal happiness
is a question of how the chances will be used. It follows that
if men do not grow in their knowledge of life and in their
intelligent judgment of the rules of right living as rapidly
as they gain control over physical resources, they will not
win happiness at all. They will simply accumulate chances
which they do not know how to use.</p>

<p>The observation which has just been made about individual
happiness has also a public or social aspect which
is important. It is essential that the political institutions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
the social code, and the accepted notions which constitute
public opinion should develop in equal measure with the
increase of power over nature. The penalty of failure to
maintain due proportion between the popular philosophy
of life and the increase of material comfort will be social
convulsions, which will arrest civilization and will subject
the human race to such a reaction toward barbarism as
that which followed the fall of the Roman Empire. It
is easy to see that at the present moment our popular
philosophy of life is all in confusion. The old codes are
breaking down; new ones are not yet made; and even
amongst people of standing, to whom we must look to
establish the body of public opinion, we hear the most
contradictory and heterogeneous doctrines about life and
society.</p>

<p>The growth of the United States has done a great deal
to break up the traditional codes and creeds which had
been adopted in Europe. The civilized world being divided
into two parts, one old and densely populated and the other
new and thinly populated, social phenomena have been
produced which, although completely covered by the same
laws of social force, have appeared to be contradictory.
The effect has been to disturb and break up the faith of
philosophers and students in the laws, and to engender
numberless fallacies amongst those who are not careful
students. The popular judgment especially has been disordered
and misled. The new country has offered such
chances as no generation of men has ever had before. It
has not, however, enabled any man to live without work,
or to keep capital without thrift and prudence; it has not
enabled a man to “rise in the world” from a position of
ignorance and poverty, and at the same time to marry
early, spend freely, and bring up a large family of children.</p>

<p>The men of this generation, therefore, without distinction
of class, and with only individual exceptions, suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
from the discontent of an appetite excited by a taste of
luxury, but held far below satiety. The power to appreciate
a remote future good, in comparison with a present one,
is a distinguishing mark of highly civilized men, but if it
is not combined with powers of persevering industry
and self-denial, it degenerates into mere day-dreaming and
the diseases of an overheated imagination. If any number
of persons are of this character, we have morbid discontent
and romantic ambition as social traits. Our literature,
especially our fiction, bears witness to the existence of
classes who are corrupted by these diseases of character.
We find classes of persons who are whining and fault-finding,
and who use the organs of public discussion and deliberation
in order to put forth childish complaints and impossible
demands, while they philosophize about life like the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>. Of course this whole tone of thought and mode
of behavior is as far as possible from the sturdy manliness
which meets the problems of life and wins victories as much
by what it endures as by what it conquers.</p>

<p>Our American life, by its ease, exerts another demoralizing
effect on a great many of us. Hundreds of our
young people grow up without any real discipline; life
is made easy for them, and their tastes and wishes are
consulted too much; they grow to maturity with the notion
that they ought to find the world only pleasant and easy.
Every one knows this type of young person, who wants to
find an occupation which he would “like,” and who discusses
the drawbacks of difficulty or disagreeableness in
anything which offers. The point here referred to is, of
course, entirely different from another and still more lamentable
fact, that is, the terrible inefficiency and incapability
of a great many of the people who are complaining and
begging. If any one wants a copyist, he will be more
saddened than annoyed by the overwhelming applications
for the position. The advertisements which are to be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
in the newspapers of widest circulation, offering a genteel
occupation to be carried on at home, not requiring any
previous training, by which two or three dollars a day may
be earned, are a proof of the existence of a class to which
they appeal. How many thousand people in the United
States want just that kind of employment! What a beautiful
world this would be if there were any such employment!</p>

<p>Then, again, our social ambition is often silly and mischievous.
Our young people despise the occupations which
involve physical effort or dirt, and they struggle “up”
(as we have agreed to call it) into all the nondescript and
irregular employments which are clean and genteel. Our
orators and poets talk about the “dignity of labor,” and
neither they nor we believe in it. Leisure, not labor, is
dignified. Nearly all of us, however, have to sacrifice our
dignity, and labor, and it would be to the purpose if, instead
of declamation about dignity, we should learn to respect,
in ourselves and each other, work which is good of its kind,
no matter what the kind is. To spoil a good shoemaker
in order to make a bad parson is surely not going “up”;
and a man who digs well is by all sound criteria superior
to the man who writes ill. Everybody who talks to
American schoolboys thinks that he does them and his
country service if he reminds them that each one of them
has a chance to be President of the United States, and our
literature is all the time stimulating the same kind of senseless
social ambition, instead of inculcating the code and the
standards which should be adopted by orderly, sober, and
useful citizens.</p>

<p>The consequences of the observations which have now
been grouped together are familiar to us all. Population
tends from the country to the city. Mechanical and
technical occupations are abandoned, and those occupations
which are easy and genteel are overcrowded. Of
course the persons in question must be allowed to take their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
own choice, and seek their own happiness in their own way,
but it is inevitable that thousands of them should be disappointed
and suffer. If the young men abandon farms
and trades to become clerks and bookkeepers, the consequence
will be that the remuneration of the crowded
occupations will fall, and that of the neglected occupations
will rise; if the young women refuse to do housework, and
go into shops, stores, telegraph offices and schools, the
wages of the crowded occupations will fall, while those of
domestic servants advance. If women in seeking occupation
try to gain admission to some business like telegraphing,
in competition with men, they will bid under the
men. Similar effects would be produced if a leisure class
in an old country should be compelled by some social
convulsion to support themselves. They would run down
the compensation for labor in the few occupations which
they could enter.</p>

<p>Now the question is raised whether there is any remedy
for the low wages of the crowded occupations, and the
question answers itself: there is no remedy except not to
continue the causes of the evil. To strike, that is, to say
that the workers will not work in their chosen line, yet
that they will not leave it for some other line, is simply
suicide. Neither can any amount of declamation, nor even
of law-making, force a man who owns a business to submit
the control of it to a man who does not own it. The telegraphers
have an occupation which requires training and
skill, but it is one which is very attractive in many respects
to those who seek manual occupation; it is also an occupation
which is very suitable, at least in many of its branches,
for women. The occupation is therefore capable of a
limited monopoly. The demand that women should be
paid equally with men is, on the face of it, just, but its real
effect would be to keep women out of the business. It
was often said during the telegraphers’ strike that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
demand of the strikers was just, because their wages were
less than those of artisans. The argument has no force at
all. The only question was whether the current wages
for telegraphing were sufficient to bring out an adequate
supply of telegraphers. If the growing boys prefer to be
artisans, the wages of telegraphers will rise. If, even at
present rates, boys and girls continue to prefer telegraphing
to handicraft or housework, the wages of telegraphers will
fall. Could, then, a strike advance at a blow the wages
of all who are now telegraphers? There was only one
reason to hope so, and that was that the monopoly of the
trade might prove stringent enough and the public inconvenience
great enough to force a concession—which would,
however, have been speedily lost again by an increased
supply of telegraphers.</p>

<p>Now let us ask what the state of the case would be if it
was really possible for the telegraphers to make a successful
strike. They have a very close monopoly; six years ago
they nearly arrested the transportation of the country
for a fortnight; but they were unable to effect their object.
More recently the freight-handlers struck against the competition
of a new influx of foreign unskilled laborers, and
in vain. The printers might make a combination, and try
to force an advance in wages by arresting the publication
of all the newspapers on a given day, but there are so many
persons who could set type, in case of need, that such an
attempt would be quite hopeless. In any branch of ordinary
handicraft there would be no possibility of creating a
working monopoly or of producing a great public calamity
by a strike. If we go on to other occupations we see that
bookkeepers, clerks, and salesmen could not as a body
combine and strike; much less could teachers do so; still
less could household servants do so. Finally, farmers and
other independent workers could not do it at all. In short,
a striker is a man who says: “I mean to get my living by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
doing this thing and no other thing as my share of the social
effort, and I do not mean to do this thing except on such
and such terms.” He therefore proposes to make a contract
with his fellow-men and to dictate the terms of it.
Any man who can do this must be in a very exceptional
situation; he must have a monopoly of the service in
question, and it must be one of which his fellow-men have
great need. If, then, the telegraphers could have succeeded
in advancing their wages fifteen per cent simply
because they had agreed to ask for the advance, they must
have been far better off than any of the rest of their fellowmen.</p>

<p>Our fathers taught us the old maxim: Cut your coat
according to your cloth; but the popular discussions of
social questions seem to be leading up to a new maxim:
Demand your cloth according to your coat. The fathers
thought that a man in this world must do the best he
could with the means he had, and that good training and
education consisted in developing skill, sagacity, and
thrift to use resources economically; the new doctrine
seems to be that if a man has been born into this world he
should make up his mind what he needs here, formulate his
demands, and present them to “society” or to the “state.”
He wants congenial and easy occupation, and good pay for
it. He does not want to be hampered by any limitations
such as come from a world in which wool grows, but not
coats; in which iron ore is found, but not weapons and
tools; in which the ground will produce wheat, but only
after hard labor and self-denial; in which we cannot eat
our cake and keep it; in which two and two make only four.
He wants to be guaranteed a “market,” so as not to suffer
from “overproduction.” In private life and in personal
relations we already estimate this way of looking at things
at its true value, but as soon as we are called upon to deal
with a general question, or a phenomenon of industry in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
which a number of persons are interested, we adopt an
entirely conventional and unsound mode of discussion.
The sound gospel of industry, prudence, painstaking, and
thrift is, of course, unpopular; we all long to be emancipated
from worry, anxiety, disappointment, and the whole train
of cares which fall upon us as we work our way through
the world. Can we really gain anything in that struggle
by organizing for a battle with each other? This is the
practical question. Is there any ground whatever for
believing that we shall come to anything, by pursuing this
line of effort, which will be of any benefit to anybody?
If a man is dissatisfied with his position, let him strive to
better it in one way or another by such chances as he can
find or make, and let him inculcate in his children good
habits and sound notions, so that they may live wisely and
not expose themselves to hardship by error or folly; but
every experiment only makes it more clear that for men to
band together in order to carry on an industrial war, instead
of being a remedy for disappointment in the ratio of satisfaction
to effort, is only a way of courting new calamity.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Anyone</span> who has read with attention the current
discussion of labor topics must have noticed that
writers start from assumptions, in regard to the doctrine
of wages, which are as divergent as notions on the same
subject-matter well can be. It appears, therefore, that
we must have a dogma of wages, that we cannot reason
correctly about the policy or the rights of the wages system
until we have such a dogma, and that, in the meantime,
it is not strange that confusion and absurdity should be
the chief marks of discussion carried on before this prime
condition is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Some writers assume that wages can be raised if the
prices of products be raised, and that no particular difficulty
would be experienced in raising prices; others assume
that wages could be raised if the employers would be satisfied
with smaller profits for themselves; still others assume
that wages could be raised or lowered according as the
cost of living rises or falls. These are common and popular
assumptions, and have nothing to do with the controversies
of professional economists about the doctrine of wages.
The latter are a disgrace to the science, and have the especial
evil at this time that the science cannot respond to the chief
demand now made upon it.</p>

<p>If the employer could simply add any increase of wages
to his prices, and so recoup himself at the expense of the
consumer, no employer would hold out long against a
strike. Why should he? Why should he undertake loss,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
worry, and war, for the sake of the consumers behind him?
If an employer need only submit to a positive and measurable
curtailment of his profits, in order to avoid a strike
and secure peace, it is probable that he would in almost
every case submit to it. But if the employees should demand
five per cent advance, and the employer should grant
it, adding so much to his prices, they would naturally and
most properly immediately demand another five per cent,
to be charged to the consumers in the same way. There
would be no other course for men of common sense to pursue.
They would repeat this process until at some point or other
they found themselves arrested by some resistance which
they could not overcome. Similarly, if wages could be
increased at the expense of the employer’s gains, the
employer who yielded one increase would have to yield
another, until at some point he decided to refuse and resist.
In either case, where and what would the limit be?
Whenever the point was reached at which some unconquerable
resistance was encountered, the task of the economist
would begin.</p>

<p>There is no rule whatever for determining the share which
any one ought to get out of the distribution of products
through the industrial organization, except that he should
get all that the market will give him in return for what he
has put into it. Whenever, therefore, the limit is reached,
the task of the economist is to find out the conditions by
which this limit is determined.</p>

<p>Now it is the character of the modern industrial system
that it becomes more and more impersonal and automatic
under the play of social forces which act with natural
necessity; the system could not exist if they did not so
act, for it is constructed in reliance upon their action according
to ascertainable laws. The condition of all social
actions and reactions is therefore set in the nature of the
forces which we have learned to know on other fields of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
scientific investigation, and which are different here only
inasmuch as they act in a different field and on different
material. The relations of parties, therefore, in the industrial
organism is such as the nature of the case permits.
The case may permit of a variety of relations, thus providing
some range of choice.</p>

<p>A person who comes into the market, therefore, with
something to sell, cannot raise the price of it because he
wants to do so, or because his “cost of production” has
been raised. He has already pushed the market to the
utmost, and raised the price as high as supply and demand
would allow, so as to win as large profits as he could. How,
then, can he raise it further, just because his own circumstances
make it desirable for him so to do? If the market
stands so that he can raise his price, he will do it, whether
his cost of production has increased or not. Neither can
an employer reduce his own profits at will; he will immediately
perceive that he is going out of business, and distributing
his capital in presents.</p>

<p>The difficulty with a strike, therefore, is, that it is an
attempt to move the whole industrial organization, in which
all the parts are interdependent and intersupporting.
It is not, indeed, impossible to do this, although it is very
difficult. The organization has a great deal of elasticity
in its parts—an aggressive organ can win something at
the expense of others. Everything displaces everything
else; but if force enough is brought to bear, a general displacement
and readjustment may be brought about. An
organ which has been suffering from the aggression of
others may right itself. It is only by the collision of social
pressure, constantly maintained, that the life of the organism
is kept up, and its forces are developed to their full
effect.</p>

<p>Strikes are not necessarily connected with violence to
either persons or property. Violence is provided for by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
the criminal law. Taking strikes by themselves, therefore,
it may be believed that they are not great evils; they are
costly, but they test the market. Supply and demand does
not mean that the social forces will operate of themselves;
the law, as laid down, assumes that every party will struggle
to the utmost for its interests—if it does not do so, it will
lose its interests. Buyers and sellers, borrowers and lenders,
landlords and tenants, employers and employees, and all
other parties to contracts, must be expected to develop
their interests fully in the competition and struggle of
life. It is for the health of the industrial organization
that they should do so. The other social interests are in
the constant habit of testing the market, in order to get all
they can out of it. A strike, rationally begun and rationally
conducted, only does the same thing for the wage-earning
interest.</p>

<p>The facts stare us plainly in the face, if we will only
look at them, that the wages of the employees and the
price of the products have nothing to do with each other;
that the wages have nothing to do with the profits of the
employer; that they have nothing to do with the cost of
living or with the prosperity of the business. They are
really governed by the supply and demand of labor, as
every strike shows us, and by nothing else.</p>

<p>Turning to the moral relations of the subject, we are
constantly exhorted to do something to improve the relations
of employer and employee. I submit that the
relation in life which has the least bad feeling or personal
bitterness in it is the pure business relation, the relation
of contract, because it is a relation of bargain and consent
and equivalence. Where is there so much dissension and
bitterness as in family matters, where people try to act
by sentiment and affection? The way to improve the relation
of employer and employee is not to get sentiment
into it, but to get sentiment out of it. We are told that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
classes are becoming more separated, and that the poor
are learning to hate the rich, although there was a time when
no class hatreds existed. I have sought diligently in history
for the time when no class hatreds existed between rich
and poor. I cannot find any such period, and I make bold
to say that no one can point to it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I have</span> attempted to show, in foregoing essays,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> what
an immense rôle is played by monopoly throughout
the whole social life of mankind in all its stages. There
would not be any struggle for existence if it were not true
that the supply in nature of the things necessary for human
existence is niggardly. The struggle for existence consists
in a contest against the constraints by which human life
is surrounded; the process by which men have won something
in that contest, in the course of time, has consisted in
playing off one of nature’s monopolies against another—the
process, namely, which we call “employing natural agents.”
On its social and political side, the advance has consisted
in securing for the individual a chance in some degree to
control his own destiny; not to be at the sport of natural
and social forces, but to bring his own energy to bear to
enlarge his own conditions of enjoyment and survival.</p>

<p>At every stage of history, however, the natural monopolies
have formed the basis of social and political
monopolies. The possession of those powers which, under
the circumstances, were most efficient for the acquisition
of what men want has always given superiority and dominion
in human society, whether those powers were physical
force, beauty, learning, virtue, capital, or anything else.
Where does any one find ground to believe that the fact
will ever be different, and that those who have the powers
which are most potent in the society in which they live
will use those powers, not to get the things which all men
want for themselves, but to get those same things for other
people?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>The fashion has always been in the past for those who
possessed the essential powers to take control of the state
and realize their monopoly in that way. If plutocracy
should now prevail it would be simply a repetition of that
experience. The only device which has ever given promise
of wider and more humane organization of the state is
constitutional liberty, which compels, by the intervention
of institutions created to serve this purpose, the ruling
class, whoever they were, to respect the recognized and
defined rights of all the rest.</p>

<p>Now, democracy having sapped and dissolved all the
inherited forms of social organization and reduced the social
body to atoms, it is most interesting to observe the inevitable
recurrence of all the old tendencies, in new forms
fitted to the times. Some of us thought that liberty was
won forever, and that the race was nevermore to be disturbed
by its old problems, but it is already apparent that,
when a society is resolved into its constituent atoms, the
question under what forces, and upon what nuclei, it will
crystallize into new forms, has acquired an importance
never known before.</p>

<p>Just now public attention is all absorbed by the new
name “trust” applied to one of these phenomena. I can
see nothing new in a trust as compared with the rings,
pools, etc., with which we have been familiar during this
generation, except the guarantee which the trust secures
to all the members of the same that no one inside of it shall
play traitor to the rest. The greatest difficulty with
modern combinations has been that there have been no
sanctions by which the members could be bound, and that
the profits of the insider who turned against his comrades
have always been an irresistible temptation. In the
mediæval guilds, which were “trusts” of the most solid
construction, the sanctions were of the sternest kind—religious,
political, and social—and yet they never succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
in their purpose. In modern times, as is well known
to all who are acquainted with the attempts which have
been made, inside of various branches of industry, to
arrange agreements which have not been large enough
or public enough to get into the newspapers the
difficulty of enforcing loyalty against those who felt strong
enough to beat the rest if they should go alone, or against
those who saw a chance to sell out on the rest, or against
those who were in desperate straits for cash, has been the
constant stumbling-block. Fifty years ago, in the last
days of the United States Bank, Nicholas Biddle organized
a cotton trust, to try to control the cotton market of the
world. It was a complete failure. In general, combinations
of this character are in constant dilemma: they
must always grow bigger and bigger, in order to encompass
a sufficient area to constitute a unit; but the bigger they
grow, the less is their internal cohesion. The exception
to this must be noted in a moment.</p>

<p>The great expansion of the market by modern inventions
in transportation has broken up all the former local
and petty monopolies, and is rapidly making of the industry
and commerce of mankind a whole which cannot be
divided by geographical lines. The conditions of competition
in such a system are no doubt onerous to the
last degree. The conditions that must be taken into
account to win success are numerous and complicated.
The nerve-strain of comprehending and of justly estimating
the factors, and of following their constant variations,
is too great for any one to endure. Foresight must
be used, yet there are so many unknown quantities that
foresight is impossible; if the attempt is made to
master all the unknown quantities, then the task is so
enormous that it cannot be accomplished. Furthermore,
the relations with other persons in the industrial system
are necessarily close. It is impossible to escape such relations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
and it is impossible to avoid a share in the consequences
of the mistakes and incompetence of the others.
It must be added that, at a time when the advance in the
arts has forced the whole industry of the globe into intimate
relations which nothing can possibly cut off, legislative
interferences have produced artificial and erratic currents
in the industrial and commercial relations of all countries.
The consequences are disappointing and disastrous incidents
in the history of industry. At the same time the improvements
in the communication of intelligence have made it
possible for men farthest apart in space, language, and
nationality, if they have confidence in each other’s business
ability and command of capital, to coöperate by personal
agreements.</p>

<p>Trusts are an attempt to deal with this state of things.
It is, of course, a jest when the makers of a trust affirm
that they make it for the benefit of consumers, and it may
very well be doubted whether a trust is a feasible and
beneficial device in the interest of either party; but it is
wrong to overlook the fact that the trust, in its efforts to
deal with the case, and to secure orderly and rational
development, instead of heats and chills in industry, has a
real and legitimate task on hand. It is certain that there
is room for the introduction of intelligent method into
modern industry, under forms which shall be germane to
modern conditions, and it is certain that this will never be
done properly by legislation, but only by the voluntary
and intelligent coöperation of the parties interested. It is
also by no means certain that this systematization of
industry, under intelligent coöperation of the parties
conducting it, would cost consumers anything, provided
always that there was no legislation to prevent the recourse
at any time to any other sources of supply which might be
available. The economies of management under intelligent
administration are a source from which gains may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
be made which will cost the consumer nothing. The
expenses of industrial war constitute a big fund for dividends
to which the consumer does not contribute.</p>

<p>It is worth while to notice, by some familiar examples,
what the motive of a trust is; it will be found a far more
everyday matter than most people suppose. A man
who owns a house and lot buys the vacant lot adjacent in
order to control it. He and his neighbors buy up all the
vacant lots on the street in order to prevent undesirable
contact with anything which would deteriorate their property.
They have already fallen victims to the spirit of
monopoly, and are subject to all the denunciations heaped
upon aristocrats and exclusivists. In their case already
the practical difficulty of defining the unit to be comprehended,
in order to attain the object and no more, is apparent.
Examples are furnished every day in which capital
is refused for certain enterprises because it is seen that the
investment might no sooner be made than its profits might
be destroyed by another enterprise parallel with it. The
thing cannot be done at all until it is done on a scale sufficiently
large to constitute a complete unit. We are familiar
enough with the dilemma offered to us when, on the one
hand, railroads which consolidate put themselves in a
position to serve us far more efficiently, yet on the other
hand, railroads which consolidate cease to compete with
each other for our benefit. Which do we want them to do?
The railroads themselves are familiar with the experience
that they are constantly forced to make extensions in
order to secure a certain territory, that is, to establish
a closed unit, and that every extension, instead of attaining
a finality, only makes further extension unavoidable.
This is the class of facts in the industrial development of
our time which has produced the trusts, and it is certain
that they offer another motive than that of simple desire
to secure means of extortion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>I am not yet able to see that any trust can succeed unless
it is founded on a natural or legislative monopoly, and
furthermore on a monopoly whose product cannot be produced
in an amount exceeding the demand at the price which
has been customary before the formation of the trust;
and I cannot see any chance for legislation to do any good
unless it is in the repeal of all such laws as are found to furnish
a basis for the organization of an artificial monopoly.</p>

<p>It cannot have escaped the attention of the reader that
trades-unions are a monopolistic organization on the side
of labor entirely parallel with the trusts on the side of
capital, “a product of the same age and of the same forces,”
and an endeavor to deal with the same problem from the
standpoint of another interest. The motives of coercion,
discipline, and strict internal organization are the same in
both cases, and some of the sanctions are the same; for
the pools and rings have tried the boycott until they have
proved its worthlessness. There is a notion afloat that
the modern trades-union is a descendant of the mediæval
gild. It might, with equal truth, and equal futility, be asserted
that the modern college, stock exchange, and joint
stock company, are descended from the mediæval gild.
The nineteenth-century trades-union is a nineteenth-century
institution, as much or more so than the ring, pool, corner,
or trust. They are all products of the same facts in the
industrial development, and one is just as inevitable, and,
in that sense, legitimate, as the other. There are some
who, while vehemently denouncing trusts, offer us, with
great complacency and satisfaction, as a solution of the
“labor question,” the assertion that the employers and
employees ought to combine or coöperate in some way;
they do not appear to see at all that if any such thing should
be brought about it would be the most gigantic “trust”
that could possibly be conceived.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the year 1579, Conrad Roth, a merchant of Augsburg,
who had been interested in the trade in spices
between Lisbon and Germany, proposed to an officer of
the treasury of the Elector of Saxony a scheme for a company
to monopolize the pepper trade. The Elector was
one of the most enterprising and enlightened princes of his
time, and the proposition was really intended to be made
to him as the only person who could command the necessary
capital and had, at the same time, courage and energy to
undertake the enterprise.</p>

<p>A company was formed of officers of the treasury, called
the Thuringian Company, and a warehouse was prepared at
Leipzig. It was reckoned that if the company could
raise the price of pepper one groschen per pound, the profits
would be over 38,000 florins per annum. Roth and the
Thuringian Company were to participate in the enterprise
equally, but the Prince was to put up all the capital, and
Roth was to do all the work. The latter also owned a very
valuable contract with the King of Portugal, according
to which he was, for five years, to send to India money
enough to buy up all the pepper produced, so that none
could come into Europe through Egypt and Italy. Before
that time the Portuguese officers had illegally sold some of
it, so that it did get into Europe that way; but by buying
in India this was now to be stopped.</p>

<p>Roth proposed to divide Europe into three sections:
Portugal, Spain, and the West; Italy and the South;
Germany and the North. The Saxon company was to
have the last as its share of the monopoly. It was hoped
that the gains might be forced up to a much higher figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
than the one above given, if only all pepper then in Frankfort,
Venice, Nuremberg, and Hamburg could be bought up.</p>

<p>No sooner was the plan formed, however, than Roth
began to reach out after extensions to it. He wanted
to include the trade in other spices. He also proposed
that the Elector should provide the capital for an exchange
bank to do the exchange business between Leipzig and
Lisbon. Next he found that the existing postal arrangements
were entirely inadequate to the requirements of
his business, and he proposed to the Elector a complete
plan for a postal service between Italy, Germany, France,
Spain, and Portugal. Then, having found the shipping
facilities unsatisfactory, he proposed that the Elector should
enter into a contract with the King of Denmark, by which
the latter, who owned ships, should provide a regular service
between Lisbon and the Elbe.</p>

<p>These plans all show the grand energy of this projector,
and the Elector entered into them all. He could not carry
out the postal service without the consent of the Emperor,
and this he was unable to get. Roth and the Elector
were ahead of their time; the Emperor was not; he said
that the plan proposed “something new, which had never
been in use in the time of their ancestors.” The attempt
to unite private merchants in the speculation also failed
at Leipzig, and elsewhere the attitude toward it was extremely
unfriendly.</p>

<p>When the stock of pepper began to accumulate at Leipzig,
it was found that the article did not begin to be scarce
elsewhere. Although the advances of the Prince were
already far greater than he had promised when the plan
was formed, it was found impossible to begin sales until
all the pepper on the European market elsewhere could
be bought up; and at the same time reports came that, in
spite of Roth’s contract, any one who had money could
buy all the pepper he wanted in India, and that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
coming into Europe freely through Egypt and Venice.
In the spring of 1580 the supply in the cities of Holland
and Germany was ample. It appeared that Roth could
not prevent the contractors for other parts of Europe from
shipping to Germany, and the price was falling there;
instead of being at fifteen groschen, where the speculators
hoped to hold it, it was below twelve. At this point Roth’s
creditors began to put attachments on his property. All
this led the Elector to say: “We fear that there has been
a great mistake in Roth’s original and still repeated assertion
that all the pepper which comes into Europe comes
through Lisbon.”</p>

<p>In April Roth committed suicide upon hearing of the
death of the King of Portugal. It was known that the
King of Spain intended to claim the succession, and that
the Portuguese would resist; this war and the possibility
of a Spanish succession meant ruin to the speculation.
The Elector was obliged to send agents in every direction
to get possession of the assets of the company, in order
to recover his funds. In the end it appears that he escaped
without very serious loss; he sold the whole stock to a
syndicate of South German merchants, at a price which
restored all his capital. After moralizing on his experience
he declared: “Inasmuch as I am now weary and sick,
and am anxious to pass the remaining time which God
vouchsafes me in quiet, I have firmly determined to have
done with commerce, whether it would bring me gain or
loss.” “I have,” he says again, “strengthened my head
and I will have done with false commerce.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>This enterprise was plainly an attempt to exploit a
natural monopoly, and to do it by an operation which
should embrace the whole world; it was a purely money-making
scheme, unrelieved by any social or industrial advantage.
It shows how erroneous it is to suppose that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
the merchants of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were
inferior in boldness to those of to-day, or superior to them
in disposition to sacrifice themselves for the public good;
it would be easy to accumulate any amount of evidence
that they were, on the contrary, entirely unscrupulous
in the pursuit of gain, and that they were bold beyond
anything known to modern merchants. They might well
be so. This story shows what great risks, dangers, perplexities,
and disappointments they were subject to. The
risk element was plainly enormous, but the gains corresponded,
of course, and hence we find some of these men
enormously rich; but it is plain that there was no routine
to help the man who had less natural ability. There was
no regularity in any of the contributory operations, such
as shipping lines and post-office; there were no regular and
adequate banking facilities. If by “trust” we mean a
combination to exploit a monopoly, either natural or artificial,
the men of that period had made an art of that sort
of undertaking, and had a skill in it of which the moderns
have no conception.</p>

<p>One cannot help admiring the courage and energy of
this Roth. He had everything to contend with; he was
far in advance of his age. If he had lived in our time he
would have been a great captain of industry—we could
have given him something better to do than making a corner
on pepper.</p>

<p>In our current social discussions there is a special kind
of fallacy which consists in quasi-historical assertions.
For instance, it is said that the power of capital is increasing
and is greater than it ever has been. This is in form an
historical assertion, but those who make it never expect
to be held to an historical responsibility for it. They
throw it out with a kind of risk, because they are not very
accurately informed as to the power of capital in former
times, and have not heard that it used to act as it does now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Capitalists never had less <em>irresponsible</em> power than now.
It is said that monopoly is growing evil; that it never was
so great. If people choose to pass laws to make monopolies,
they must, of course, take the consequences; but there
never was a time when the control of natural monopolies
was so rational as now, and there never was a time when the
efforts of cliques to make artificial monopolies could be so
easily frustrated as now. It is said that trusts embracing
the whole world are a new and threatening danger, never
heard of before. It has seemed to me that, if we are to
have history, it might be well for once to see some facts
which illustrate “the good old times” as they really were.
Of course nothing is thereby proved as to the good or ill
of trusts; but something is proved as to the fallacy of that
class of quasi-historical assertions which I have described.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SHALL_AMERICANS_OWN_SHIPS47">SHALL AMERICANS OWN SHIPS?<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor smaller">47</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Since</span> the war, public attention has been drawn more
or less to the marked decline in American shipping.
It has been generally assumed and conceded that this was
a matter for regret, and some discussion has arisen as to
remedies—what to do, in fact, in order to bring it about
that Americans should own ships. In these discussions,
there has generally been a confusion apparent in regard
to three things which ought to be very carefully distinguished
from each other: ship-building, the carrying
trade, and foreign commerce.</p>

<p>1. As to ship-building—Americans began to build
ships, as an industry, within fifteen years after the settlement
at Massachusetts Bay. Before the Revolution they
competed successfully as ship-builders with the Dutch
and English, and they sold ships to be used by their rivals.
Tonnage and navigation laws played an important part
in the question of separation between the colonies and
England, and the same laws took an important place
in the formation of the Federal Constitution. One generation
was required for the people of this country to get over
the hard logical twist in the notion that laws which were
pernicious when laid by Great Britain were beneficial
when laid by ourselves. The vacillation which has marked
the history of our laws about tonnage and navigation is
such that it does not seem possible to trace the effects of
legislation upon ship-building. In the decade 1850–1860 a
very great decline in the number of ships built, especially
for ocean traffic, began to be marked. Sails began to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
way to steam, but the building of steamships required great
advantages of every kind in the production of engines and
other apparatus—that is, it required the presence, in a
highly developed state, of a number of important auxiliary
and coöperating industries. As iron was introduced into
ship-building, of course the ship-building industry became
dependent upon cheap supplies of iron as it had before
been dependent on cheap supplies of wood. No doubt
these changes in the conditions of the industry itself have
been the chief cause of the decline in ship-building in this
country, and legislation has had only incidental effects.
It is a plain fact of history that the decline in ship-building
began before the war and the high tariff. Of course the
effects produced by changes in the conditions of an industry
are inevitable; they are not to be avoided by any legislation.
They are annoying because they break up acquired habits
and established routine, and they involve loss in a change
from one industry to another, but legislation can never do
anything but cause that loss to fall on some other set of
people instead of on those directly interested. Within the
last few years it has become certain that steel is to be the
material of ocean vessels—a new improvement which will
not tend to bring the industry back to this country. On
the whole, therefore, the decline in ship-building of the
last twenty-five years seems to indicate that somebody
else than ourselves must build the world’s ships for the
present. We have, by legislative devices, forced the
production of a few ocean steamers, but these cases prove
nothing to the contrary of our inference. If this nation
has a hobby for owning some ships built in this country,
and is willing to pay enough for the gratification of that
hobby, no doubt it can secure the pleasure it seeks. A
fisherman who has caught nothing sometimes buys fish
at a fancy price; he saves himself mortification and gets
a dinner, but the possession of the fish does not prove that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
he has profitably employed his time or that he has had
sport.</p>

<p>2. The carrying trade differs from ship-building as carting
differs from wagon-building. Carrying is the industry
of men who own ships; their interests are more or less hostile
to those of the ship-builders. Ship owners want to buy
new ships at low prices; they want the number of competing
ships kept small; they want freights high. In all
these points the interest of the ship-builder is the opposite:
the ship owner is indifferent where he gets his ships; he only
wants them cheap and good. There is no sentiment in
the matter any more than there is in the purchase of wagons
by an express company, or carriages by a livery-stable
keeper.</p>

<p>3. Foreign commerce is still another thing. It consists
in the exchange of the products of one country for
those of another. The merchant wants plenty of ships
to carry all the goods at the lowest possible freights, but it
is of no importance to him where the ships were built,
or who owns and sails them.</p>

<p>A statement and definition of these three industries
suffices to show what confusion must arise in any discussion
in which they are not properly distinguished. It is plain
that there are three different questions: (1) Can the farmer
build a vehicle? (2) Can he get his crop carried to market?
(3) Can he sell his crop? It is evident that a country
which needs a protective tariff on iron and steel must give
up all hopes of building ships for ocean traffic. For the
country which, by the hypothesis, needs a protective
tariff on iron and steel cannot produce those articles as
cheaply as some other country. Its ships, however, must
compete upon the ocean with those of the country which
has cheap iron and steel. The former embody a larger
capital than the latter, and they must be driven from the
ocean. If, then, subsidies are given to protect the carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
trade, when prosecuted in ships built of protected iron,
the loss is transferred from the ship owners to the people
who pay taxes on shore. These taxes, however, add to
the cost of production of all things produced in the country,
and thereby lessen the power of the country to compete
in foreign commerce. This lessens the amount of goods
to be carried both out and in, lowers freights, throws ships
out of use, and checks the building of ships; and the whole
series of legislative aids and encouragements must be
begun over again, with a repetition and intensification of
the same results. As long as the system lasts it works
down, and the statistics show, very naturally, that fewer
and fewer ships are built in the country, and that less and
less of the carrying trade is carried on under the national
flag. In view of the three different and sometimes adverse
interests which are connected by their relation to the shipping
question, it is not strange that when the representatives
of those interests meet to try to consider that question,
there should simply be a scramble between them to see
which can capture the convention. The last convention
of this sort was captured by the owners of a lot of unsalable
and unsailable old hulks, who had hit upon the brilliant
idea of getting the nation to pay them an annual bounty
for the use of their antiquated and dilapidated property.
Strange to say, in a country which is charged with being
too practical and hardheaded, this proposition received
respectful attention and consideration. It is also strange
that our people should believe that taxing farmers to
force the production of iron, taxing farmers again to force
the production of ships out of protected iron, and taxing
farmers again to pay subsidies to enable protected ships
to do business, is a way to make this country rich.</p>

<p>So soon as the three different industries, or departments
of business, which I have described are distinguished from
each other, it is apparent that the fundamental one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
three is foreign commerce. If we have no commerce we
need no carrying, and it would be absurd to build ships;
if we have foreign commerce its magnitude determines the
amount of demand there is for freight and for ships. The
circle of taxation which I have mentioned, and which is
obviously only a kind of circuit, described from and
upon the farmer as a center and fulcrum to bear the weight
of the whole, is necessarily and constantly vicious, because
it presses down on the foreign commerce, which is the proper
source of support for carrying and ship-building. On the
other hand, the emancipation of foreign commerce from
all trammels of every sort is the only means of increasing
the natural, normal, and spontaneous support of carrying
and ship-building, assuming that the carrying trade and
ship-building are ends in themselves.</p>

<p>It is, however, no object at all for a country to have
either ship-building industry, or carrying trade, or foreign
commerce; herein lies the fundamental fallacy of all the
popular and Congressional discussions about ships and
commerce. It is only important that the whole population
should be engaged in those industries which will pay the
best under the circumstances of the country. For the sake
of exposing the true doctrine about the matter, we may
suppose (what is not conceivable as a possible fact) that
a country might not find greater profit in the exportation
of any part of any of its products than in the home use of
the same. If this could be true, and if it were realized,
the proof of it would be that no foreign trade would exist.
There would be no ground for regret since the people would
be satisfied and better off than as if they had a foreign
trade. Carrying trade and ship-building would not exist.</p>

<p>If a country had a foreign trade of any magnitude whatever,
it would not be any object for that country to do its
own carrying. The figures which show the amount paid
by the people of the United States to non-American ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
owners for freight, and the figures which show the small
percentage of our foreign commerce which is carried under
the American flag, in themselves prove nothing at all.
The only question which is of importance is this: are the
people of the United States better employed now than they
would be if engaged in owning and sailing ships? If they
were under no restraints or interferences, that question also
would answer itself. If Americans owned no ships and
sailed no ships, but hired the people of other countries to
do their ocean transportation for them, it would simply
prove that Americans had some better employment for their
capital and labor. They would get their transportation
accomplished as cheaply as possible. That is all they
care for, and it would be as foolish for any nation to insist
on doing its own ocean transportation, devoting to this
use capital and labor which might be otherwise more
profitably employed, as it would be for a merchant to insist
on doing his own carting, when some person engaged in
carting offered him a contract on more advantageous terms
than those on which he could do the work.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the people of a country which had little
foreign commerce might find it very advantageous to
prosecute the carrying trade. In history, the great trading
nations have been those which had a small or poor territory
at home: the Dutch were the great carriers of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, when the foreign commerce
of their own territory was insignificant; the New
Englanders of the last century and of the first quarter of
this century became the carriers of commodities to and
fro between all parts of the world, especially between our
middle and southern states and the rest of the world. They
took to the sea because their land did not furnish them with
products which could remunerate their capital and labor so
well as the carrying trade did. They won a high reputation
for the merchant service, which was in their hands, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
earned fortunes by energy, enterprise, promptitude, and
fidelity. The carrying trade is an industry like any other;
it is neither more nor less desirable in itself than any other.
In any natural and rational state of things it would be
absurd to be writing essays about it. If any one thought
he could make more profit in that business than in some
other he would set about it. When the census was taken
he would be found busy at that business, would be so
reported, and that would be the end of the matter as a
phenomenon of public interest.</p>

<p>If a nation had foreign commerce, and some of its citizens
found the carrying trade an advantageous employment
for their labor and capital as compared with other possible
industries in the country, it would not follow that some
other citizens of that country ought to engage in ship-building.
It is no object to build ships, but only to get
such ships as are wanted, in the most advantageous manner.
If a man should refuse to carry on a carting business unless
he could make his own wagons, it would be such a
reflection on his good sense that his business credit would
be very low. If some Americans could buy and sail ships so
as to make profits, what is the sense of saying that they
shall not do it because some other Americans cannot build
ships at a profit? Only one answer to this question has
ever been offered by anybody, and that is the prediction
that, some day, if we go without ships long enough, we shall,
by the mere process of going without, begin to get some—a
prediction for which the prophets give no guarantee,
in addition to their personal authority, save the fact that
we have fewer ships and worse ones every year.</p>

<p>I have said above that, if there were no restraints or
interferences, we should simply notice whether any Americans
took to the carrying trade or not, and should thence
infer that they might or might not be better employed in
some other industry. It is impossible, now, to say whether,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
if all restrictions were removed, the carrying trade or ship-building
would be a profitable industry in the United States
or not. Any opinion given by anybody on that point is
purely speculative. The present state of the iron and
steel industries, and of the manufacture of engines and
machinery, is so artificial that no one can judge what would
be the possibilities of those industries under an entirely
different state of things. It is, however, just because the
present state of things prevents a free trial that it is indefensible;
we are working in the dark and on speculation all
the time and have none of the natural and proper tests
and guarantees for what we are doing. We are controlled
by the predictions of prophets, the notions of dogmatizers,
the crude errors of superficial students of history, the wrong-headed
inferences of shallow observers, and the selfish
machinations of interested persons. We can distinguish
many forces which are at work on our ship-building and on
our carrying trade, but none of them are genuine or respectable.
We are submitting to restraints and losses, and
we have no guarantee whatever that we shall ever win
any compensation. The teaching of economic science is
distinctly that we never shall win any. We are expending
capital without any measurement or adjustment of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quid pro quo</i>; we are spending without calculation, and
receiving something or nothing—we do not know which.
The wrong of all this is not in the assumption that we have
not certain industries which we would have (for we cannot
tell whether that is so or not), but the wrong is in the
arbitrary interference which prevents us from having them,
if any man wants to put his capital into them, and which
prevents us from obtaining the proper facts on which to
base a judgment about the state and relations of industries
in the country.</p>

<p>Whenever the question of ships is raised, the clamor
for subsidies and bounties is renewed, and we are told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
again that England has established her commerce by
subsidies. It would be well if we could have an understanding,
once for all, whether England’s example is a good
argument or not. As she has tried, at some time or other,
nearly every conceivable economic folly, and has also
made experiment of some sound economic principles, all
disputants find in her history facts to suit them, and it
needs only a certain easily acquired skill in misunderstanding
things to fashion any required argument from the
economic history of England. Some of our writers and
speakers seem to be under a fascination which impels them
to accept as authoritative examples the follies of English
history, and to reject its sound lessons. In the present case,
however, the matter stands somewhat differently. England
is a great manufacturing area; it imports food and raw
materials, and exports finished products; it has, therefore,
a general and public interest in maintaining communication
with all parts of the world. The analogy in our case is
furnished by the subsidized railroads in our new states, or,
perhaps even better, by the mail routes which we sustain
all over our territory, from general considerations of public
advantage, although many such routes do not pay at all.
Subsidies to ships for the mere sake of having ships, or
ocean traffic, when there is no business occasion for the subsidized
lines, would have no analogy with English subsidies.</p>

<p>If then the question is put: Shall Americans own ships?
I do not see how any one can avoid the simple answer:
Yes, if they want them. Universally, if an American wants
anything, he ought to have it if he can get it, and if he hurts
no one else by getting it. To enter on the question whether
he is going to make it or buy it, and whether he is going
to buy it of A or of B, is an impertinence. We boast a
great deal of having a free country; our orators shout
themselves hoarse about liberty and freedom. Stop one
of them, however, and ask him if he means free trade and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
free ships, and he will demur. No; not that; that will not
do. He is in favor of freedom for himself and his friends
in those respects in which they want liberty against other
people, but he is not in favor of freedom for other people
against restraints which are advantageous to him and his
political allies. He is in favor of freedom for those who are
being oppressed—by somebody else; not for those who
are being oppressed by himself. I heard it asserted not
long ago that we have no monopolies in this country,
<em>because</em> it is a free country. It is not a free country, because
there are more artificial monopolies in it than in any other
country in the world. The popular notion that it is free
rises from the fact that there are fewer natural monopolies
in it than in any other great civilized country. It is necessary,
however, to go to Turkey or Russia to find instances
of legislative and administrative abuses to equal the existing
laws and regulations of the United States about ships,
the carrying trade, and foreign commerce. These laws
have been brought to public attention again and again,
but apparently with little effect in awakening popular
attention, while the newspapers carry all over the country
details about abuses in Ireland, Russia, and South Africa.
We should stop bragging about a free country and about
the enlightened power of the people in a democratic republic
to correct abuses, while laws remain which treat the buying,
importing, owning, and sailing of ships as pernicious actions,
or, at least, as doubtful and suspicious ones. I have no conception
of a free man or a free country which can be satisfied
if a citizen of that country may not own a ship, if he wants
one, getting it in any legitimate manner in which he might
acquire other property; or may not sail one, if he finds
that a profitable industry suited to his taste and ability;
or may not exchange the products of his labor with that
person, whoever he may be, who offers the most advantageous
terms.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the Continental Congress met in 1774, few
persons in the colonies perceived that the ties to
the mother country were about to be severed, and few, if
any, were republicans in theory, or contemplated a “revolution”
in the political system. The desire for independence
was developed during 1775, and the question as to the form
of government to be adopted came up by consequence. It
presented no real difficulty. The political organization of
some of the colonies was such already that there were no
signs of dependence except the arms and flag, the form of
writs, and a responsibility to the Lords of Trade which sat
very lightly upon them. Necessary changes being made
in these respects, those colonies stood as complete republics.
The others conformed to this model.</p>

<p>In bringing about these changes great interest was developed
in political speculations, an interest which found
its first direction from Paine’s “Common Sense,” and was
sustained by diligent reading of Burgh’s “Political Disquisitions,”
and Macaulay’s “History of England.” The
same speculations continued to be favorite subjects of
discussion for twenty-five years afterwards. The journals
of the time were largely made up of long essays by writers
with fanciful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noms de plume</i>, who discussed no simple
matters of detail, but the fundamental principles of politics
and government. The method of treatment was not
historical, unless we must except crude and erroneous
generalizations on classical history, and it seemed to be
believed that the colonial history of this country was especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
unfit to furnish guidance for the subsequent period;
but the disquisitions in question pursued an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> method,
starting from the broadest and most abstract assumptions.
The same method has marked American political philosophy,
so far as there has been any such thing, ever since.
It is very much easier than the method which requires a
laborious study of history.</p>

<p>The natural effect of the war, but still more of the doctrines
in regard to liberty taught by Paine, and of the deplorable
policy of local terrorism pursued by the Committees
of Safety against Tories and Refugees, was to produce and
bring into prominence a class of active, shallow men, who
felt their new powers and privileges but not the responsibility
which ought to go with these. The old colonial
bureaucracy, which had enjoyed all the social preëminence
that colonial life permitted, was gone. Office was open
to many who, before the war, had little chance of attaining
it. They sought it eagerly, expecting to enjoy the
social advantages they had formerly envied. In the northern
states a class of eager office-seekers arose who gained a
great influence, saw their arena in the states especially, and
jealously opposed the power of the Confederation. This
class made hatred to England almost a religion, and testified
to their political virtues by persecuting Tories and Refugees.
They found popular grievances also ready to their
hand as a means of advancement. The mass of the people
had been impoverished by the war. The attempts at commercial
war had reacted upon the nation with great severity.
The paper issues of the Congress and the states had wrought
their work to derange values, violate contracts, inflate
credit, and destroy confidence. On the return of peace the
industries which had been sustained only by war ceased to
be profitable; the reduction of prices spread general ruin
and left thousands indebted and impoverished. The consequence
was discontent and disorder. All this was heightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
by the contrast with another class which had been
enriched by privateering, contracts, and “financiering.”
The soldier who returned in rags, bringing only a few bits
of scrip worth fifteen or twenty cents on the dollar, found
his family in want, and some of his neighbors, who had
borne few of the sacrifices of the war, enriched by it and
now enjoying its fruits. It seemed to this whole class that
they had not yet got liberty, or that they did not know what
it was. They did not look for it to a closer union.</p>

<p>This party, for it soon became a party, found an alliance
in a quarter where it would hardly have been expected, in
the slave-owning planters of the South—an alliance which
has been of immense importance in our political history.
The planters, at the outbreak of the war, had been heavily
indebted to English capitalists and merchants. They now
feared that they would be compelled to pay their debts, and
they saw in the treaty-making power of the general government
the source from which this compulsion would come.
They therefore opposed any union which would strengthen
and give vigor to that power. To this party were added
those who had adopted, on theoretical and philosophical
grounds, the enthusiasm for liberty which was then prevalent
in both hemispheres. It should be added to the
characteristics of this party that it looked with indifference
upon foreign commerce, cared little for foreign opinion,
would have been glad to be isolated from the Old World,
and had very crude opinions as to the status and relations
of European nations.</p>

<p>This party naturally went on to confound liberty with
equality, and political virtue with tenacity of rights. It
furthermore confounded power with privilege, and thought
that it must allow no civil power or authority to exist if it
meant really to exterminate aristocratic privilege. It was
not so clear in its conception of political duties, and certainly
failed to see that the best citizen is not the one who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
most tenacious of his political rights, but the one who is
most faithful to his political duties; that envy and jealousy
are not political virtues; and that equality can be attained
only by cutting off every social advance and setting up as
the standard, not what is highest, but what is a low
average.</p>

<p>An opposing party gradually formed itself of men of
wider information and superior training. These men
understood the institutions of Great Britain and their
contrast to those of any other country in Europe. They
understood just what the war had done for the Colonies.
They did not consider that it had altered the internal institutions
inherited from the mother country, or set the
Colonies adrift upon a sea of political speculation to try to
find a political utopia. Some of them joined for a time in
the prevalent opinion that the Americans were better and
purer than the rest of mankind, but experience soon taught
them their error. Tradition and experience still had
weight with them; and in making innovations they sought
development rather than destruction and reconstruction.
They were conservative by property, education, and
character.</p>

<p>To this party it was evident that the colonies had lost
much by falling out of the place in the family of nations
which they had filled as part of the British Empire, and they
believed that a similar place must now be won on an independent
footing. They understood the necessity of well-regulated
foreign relations, of foreign commerce, and of
public credit. Their general effort was, therefore, to secure
order and peace in the internal relations of the country by
establishing liberty indeed, but liberty under law; and to secure
respectability and respect abroad by fidelity to treaties
and pecuniary engagements, by a reputation for commercial
integrity, and by a development of the arts of peace.
The first requisite to all this was a more perfect union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>The two parties, therefore, formed about the issue of a
revision of the Articles of Confederation, but it was not
until the absolute necessity of the objects aimed at by the
Federalists—objects which are in their nature less directly
obvious and tangible—had been demonstrated by experience,
that this revision was brought about. The
Union was not the result of a free and spontaneous effort,
but was “extorted from the grinding necessity of a reluctant
people.” A political party which resists a proposed
movement by predicting calamitous results to flow
from it must abide by the verdict of history. Tried by
this test, the anti-Federalists are convicted of resisting the
most salutary action in our political history. The victory
was won, not by writing critical essays about the movement
and the relations of parties, but by the direct and
energetic activity of those men of that generation who had
enjoyed the greatest advantages of education and culture.</p>

<p>Three evils were inherited under the new Constitution
from the old system: slavery (which the framers of the
Constitution tolerated, thinking it on the decline), paper
money (which they thought they had eradicated), and the
mercantile theories of political economy. These three evils,
in their single or combined development, have given character
to the whole subsequent political history of the
country. One of them has been eliminated by a civil war.
The other two confront us as the great political issues of
to-day.</p>

<p>The framers of the Constitution, without having any
precise definition of a republic in mind, knew well that it
differed from a democracy. No one of them was a democrat.
They were, at the time of framing the Constitution,
under an especial dread of democracy, on account of
the rebellion in Massachusetts. They meant to make a
Constitution in order to establish organized or articulated
liberty, giving guarantees for it which should protect it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
from popular tyranny as much as from personal despotism.
Indeed, they recognized the former as a great danger, the
latter as a delusion. They therefore established a constitutional
republic. The essential feature of such a
system of government (for it is a system of government,
and not a political theory) is that political power be conferred
under a temporary and defeasible tenure. That it
be conferred by popular election is not essential, although
it is convenient in many cases. This method was the one
naturally indicated by the circumstances of the United
States. The system which was established did not pretend
to give direct effect to public opinion according to its
fluctuations. It rather interposed delays and checks in
order to secure deliberation, and it aimed to give expression
to public opinion only after it was matured. It sought
to eliminate prejudice and passion by prescribing beforehand
methods which seemed just in themselves, independently
of conflicting interests, in order that, when a
case arose, no advantage of procedure might be offered to
either party; and it aimed to subject action to organs whose
operation should be as impersonal as it is possible for the
operation of political organs to be.</p>

<p>Democracy, on the other hand, has for its essential
feature equality, and it confers power on a numerical
majority of equal political units. It is not a system of
government for a state with any but the narrowest limits.
On a wider field it is a theory as to the depositary of sovereignty.
It seizes upon majority rule, which is only a
practical expedient for getting a decision where something
must be done and a unanimous judgment as to what ought
to be done is impossible, and it makes this majority the
depositary of sovereignty, under the name of the sovereignty
of the people. This sovereign, however, is as
likely as any despot to aggrandize itself, and to promulgate
the unformulated doctrines of the divine right of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
sovereign majority to rule, the duty of passive obedience
in the minority, and that the majority can do no wrong.</p>

<p>Opposition to the Federal Constitution died out in a
year or two, and no one could be found who would confess
that he had resisted its adoption. Parties divided on
questions of detail and of interpretation, and the points
on which they differed were those by which the Constitution
imposed delays and restraints upon the popular will.
The administrations of Washington and Adams threw
continually increasing weight in favor of constitutional
guarantees, as the history of the French Revolution seemed
to the Federalists to furnish more and more convincing
proofs of the dangers of unbridled democracy. The opposition
saw nothing in that history save the extravagant
ebullitions of a people new to freedom—saw rather examples
to be imitated than dangers to be shunned. Sympathy
and gratitude came in to exercise a weighty influence
on political issues. The personal executive and the judiciary
were the chief subjects of dislike, and General
Washington himself finally incurred abuse more wanton
and severe than any President since, except the elder
Adams, has endured, because the fact was recognized that
Washington’s personality was the strongest bulwark which
the system possessed at the outset.</p>

<p>Democracy, however, was, and still is, so deeply rooted
in the physical and economic circumstances of the United
States, that the constitutional barriers set up against it
have proved feeble and vain. Fears of monarchy have now
almost ceased or are ridiculed. Monarchist and aristocrat
are now used only as epithets to put down some over-bold
critic of our political system; but in the early days
of the Republic the mass of the people believed that the
supporters of the first two administrations desired aristocracy
and monarchy. In a new country, however, with
unlimited land, the substantial equality of the people in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
property, culture, and social position is inevitable. Political
equality follows naturally. Democracy is given in
the circumstances of the case. The yeoman farmer is the
prevailing type of the population. It is only when the
pressure of population and the development of a more
complex social organization produce actual inequality in
the circumstances of individuals, that a political aristocracy
can follow and grow upon a social aristocracy. The
United States are far from having reached any such state
as yet. These facts were felt, if not distinctly analyzed
and perceived, even by those who might on theory have
preferred monarchical institutions; and, as Washington
said, there were not ten men in the country who wanted a
monarchy.</p>

<p>The Federalists repaid their opponents with a no less
exaggerated fear of their principles and intentions, regarding
them as Jacobins and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans culottes</i>, who desired to destroy
whatever was good and to produce bloodshed and
anarchy. Party spirit ran to heights seldom reached since.
Partisan abuse outstripped anything since. It was an additional
misfortune that the questions at issue were delicate
questions of foreign policy and international law. It is a
great evil in a republic that parties should divide by sympathy
with two foreign nations, and it is the greatest evil
possible that they should not believe in each other’s loyalty
to the existing constitution.</p>

<p>The deeper movement which was stirring to affect the
general attitude or standpoint from which the Constitution
was viewed (a matter, of course, of the first importance
under a written constitution), and which was changing the
constitutional republic into a democratic republic, did not
escape the observation of the most sagacious men of the
earliest days. Fisher Ames wrote to Wolcott in 1800:
“The fact really is, that over and above the difficulties of
sustaining a free government, and the freer the more difficult,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
there is a want of accordance between our system
and the state of our public opinion. The government
is republican; opinion is essentially democratic. Either
events will raise public opinion high enough to support
our government, or public opinion will pull down the government
to its own level.” The fact was that the government
could not, under the system, long remain above the
level of public opinion. The Federalists, assisted by the
prestige of Washington’s name, held it there for twelve
years; but they probably never, on any of the party issues,
even with a restricted suffrage, had a majority of the voters.
Dating the rise of parties from the time of Jay’s Treaty,
they had a majority of the House of Representatives only
under the excitement of French insult in 1798.</p>

<p>The leading men of 1787–1788, as has been said, worked
industriously and energetically for political objects. The
first decade of the Republic had not passed by, however,
before men began to estimate the cost and sacrifices of
public life and the worry of abuse and misrepresentation,
to compare this with what they could accomplish in politics,
and to abandon the contest. To the best public men
professions and other careers offered fame, fortune, honorable
and gratifying success. In public life they struggled
against, and were defeated by, noisy, active men who could
not have competed with them in any other profession.
Their best efforts were misunderstood and misrepresented.
They had no reward but the consciousness of fulfilling a
high public duty. Furthermore they lacked, as a class,
the tact and sagacity which the system indispensably requires.
The leaders of the Federal party committed a
political blunder of the first magnitude in quarrelling with
John Adams, whatever may have been his faults. They
thereby separated themselves from the mass of their own
party, and at a time when parties were so evenly balanced that
they required harmony for any chance of success; and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
put themselves in the position of a junto or cabal, trying
to dictate to the party without guiding its reason. Those
of them who had withdrawn from, or had been thrown out of
political life by the causes above mentioned were most
active in this work of disorganization. They had abandoned
that sort of task which they had engaged in at the
outset, and which, difficult as it is, is permanently incumbent
on the cultured classes of the country—to make the
culture of the nation homogeneous and uniform by imparting
and receiving, by living in and of and for the nation,
contributing to its thought and life their best stores, whatever
they are. A breach was opened there which has gone
on widening ever since, and which has been as harmful to
our culture as to our politics. On the one side it has been
left to anti-culture to control all which is indigenous and
“American”; and on the other hand American culture has
been like a plant in a thin soil, given over to a sickly dilettantism
and the slavish imitation of foreign models, ill
understood, copied for matters of form, and, as often as
not, imitated for their worst defects.</p>

<p>An actual withdrawal of the ablest men from political
life, such as we have come to deplore, began, then, at this
early day. Many others were thrown out for too great
honesty and truth in running counter to the popular notions
of the day. John Adams incurred great unpopularity
for having said that the English Constitution was one of
the grandest achievements of the human race—an assertion
which Callender disputed, with great popular success,
by dilating upon the corruption of the English administration
under George III, but an assertion which, in the
sense in which it was made, no well-informed man would
question. Sedgwick laid down the principle that the government
might claim the last man as a soldier and the last
dollar in taxation—an abstract proposition which is unquestionable,
but which Callender disputed, once more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
with great popular success, by arguing as if it were a proposition
to take the last man and the last dollar. Dexter
lost a reëlection by opposing a clause of the naturalization
law, that a foreign nobleman should renounce his titles on
being naturalized. It was opposed as idle and frivolous,
and favored as if every foreign nobleman would otherwise
become by naturalization a member of Congress. Hamilton
and Knox abandoned the public service on account of
the meagerness of their salaries. Pickering, who left office
really insolvent, and with only a few hundred dollars in
cash, was pursued by charges of corruption on the ground
of unclosed accounts. Wolcott, at the end of long and
faithful service, was charged with the responsibility for a
fire which broke out in his office, as if he had sought to
destroy the records of corrupt proceedings.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that these men abandoned public life,
and that their examples deterred others, unless they were
men born to it, who could not live out of the public
arena; but it is true now, as it was then, that men of true
culture, high character, and correct training can abandon
public political effort only by the surrender of some of the
best interests of themselves and their posterity. The pursuit
of wealth, which is the natural alternative, has always
absorbed far too much of the ambition of the nation, and
under such circumstances there could be no other result
than that a wealthy class should arise, to whom wealth
offers no honorable social power, in whom it awakens no
intellectual or political ambition, to whom it brings no
sense of responsibility, but for whom it means simply the
ability to buy what they want, men or measures, and to
enjoy sensual luxury. A class of men is produced which
mocks at the accepted notions while it uses them, and
scorns the rest of us with a scorn which is so insulting only
because it is so just. It is based on the fact that we will
not undergo the sacrifices necessary to self-defense. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
pursuit of wealth was almost the only pursuit attractive
to able men who turned their backs on the public service
in the early days. In later years professional careers and
scientific and literary pursuits have disputed to a great and
greater extent the dominion of wealth over the energies
of the nation; but politics have not yet won back their
due attraction for able and ambitious men.</p>

<p>The Federalists also held a defective political philosophy.
They did not see that the strength of a constitutional
republic such as they desired must be in the intelligent
approval and confidence of the citizens. Adams and
Hamilton agreed in supposing that some artificial bond
must be constructed to give strength to the system. Hamilton
looked for it in the interest of the wealthy class, which
he wanted to bind up in the system—a theory which
would have changed it into a plutocracy. Adams sought the
bond in ambition for social eminence, and did not see that,
where such eminence sprang only from wealth or official
rank, the very principle of human nature which he invoked
would, under the form of envy, counteract his effort.</p>

<p>The presidential election of 1801 having been thrown
into the House of Representatives, the Federalists added
to their former blunder another far more grave. Abandoning
their claims to principle and character, they took to
political intrigue and bargaining, in the attempt to elect
Burr over Jefferson. Their exit from power might otherwise
have been honorable, and they might, as an opposition
party, have made a stand for inflexible principle and
political integrity; but it was hard for them after this to
talk of those things, especially as Burr went on to develop the
character which Hamilton had warned them that he possessed.
They fell into the position of “independent voters,”
throwing their aid now with one and now with the other
faction of the majority; but history does not show that
they ever forced either one or the other to “adopt good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
measures,” for the obvious reason that the majority possessed
the initiative. The purchase of Louisiana seemed
to them to transfer the power of the Union to the southern
and frontier states, the seat of the political theories which
they regarded as reckless and lawless. They feared that
the power of the Union would be used to sacrifice commerce
and to put in operation wild theories by which the interests
of the northern and eastern states would be imperiled,
and the inherited institutions of constitutional liberty,
which they valued as their best possessions, would be overthrown.
The Embargo and Non-intercourse Acts seemed
only the fulfillment of these fears. The recourse of a minority
has always been to invoke the Constitution and to
insist upon the unconstitutionality of what they could not
resist by votes, each party in turn thereby bearing witness
to the truth that the Constitution is the real safeguard of
rights and liberty. In the last resort also the minority, if
it has been local, and has seen the majority threatening to
use the tremendous power of the Confederation to make
the interests of the minority subservient to the interests
of the rest, has felt its loyalty to the Union decline. How
far the Federalists went in this direction it is difficult to
say, but they certainly went farther than they were afterwards
willing to confess or remember. They gradually
faded out of view as a political power after the second war
and in the twenties “Federalist” became a term of reproach.</p>

<p>The opposite party, called by themselves Republicans
after 1792, took definite form in opposition to Washington’s
administration on the question of ratifying Jay’s
Treaty. They were first called Democrats in 1798, the
name being opprobrious. They adopted it, however, first
in connection with the former name; and the joint appellation,
Democratic Republicans, or either separately, was
used indifferently down to the middle of this century.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
Jefferson was the leader of this party. He did not write
any political disquisitions or aid in the attempts which
have been mentioned to form public opinion; but his expressions
in letters and fugitive writings struck in with the
tide of Democracy so aptly and exactly that he seemed to
have put into people’s mouths just the expression for the
vague notions which they had not yet themselves been
able to get into words. Jefferson, in fact, was no thinker.
He was a good specimen of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> political philosopher.
He did not reason or deduce; he dogmatized on
the widest and most rash assumptions, which were laid
down as self-evident truths. He did not borrow from the
contemporaneous French schools, for his democracy is of
a different type; but both sprang from the same germs
and pursued the same methods of speculation. Freneau,
Bache, Callender, and Duane wrought continually upon
public opinion, and Jefferson entered into the leadership
of the party they created, by virtue of a certain skill in
giving watchwords and dogmatic expressions for the ideas
which they disseminated.</p>

<p>The dogmas which Jefferson taught, or of which he was
the exponent, were not without truth. Their fallacy consisted
in embracing much falsehood, and also in excluding
the vast amount of truth which lay outside of them. For
instance, the dogma that the voice of the people is the voice
of God is not without truth, if it means that the enlightened
and mature judgment of mankind is the highest verdict on
earth as to what is true or wise. This is the truth which
is sought to be expressed in the ecclesiastical dogma of
Catholicity, but the political and the ecclesiastical dogma
have the same limitation. This verdict of mankind cannot
be obtained in any formal and concrete expression,
and is absolutely unattainable on grounds of speculation
antecedent to experiment. It is in history only; or, rather,
it constitutes history. In Jefferson’s doctrine and practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
it resolved itself simply into this practical rule: the test
of wisdom for the statesman and of truth for the philosopher
is popularity. When the statesman has a difficult practical
question before him as to what to do, according to this
theory he puts forward what seems to him best as a proposition.
If, then, the return wave of popular sympathy
comes back to him with promptitude and with the intensity
to which he is accustomed, he infers that he has proposed
wisely, and goes forward. If there is delay or uncertainty
in the response, he draws back. The actual operation of
this theory is that, if the statesman in question is the idol
of a popular majority, the approving response is quick and
sure, because the proposition comes from him, not because
the tribunal of appeal has considered or can consider the
question. If an unpopular man endeavors to use the same
test, the answer is doubtful, feeble, hesitating, or impatient,
because those to whom he appeals have not the
necessary preparation, or time, or interest to judge in the
matter. In general, the theory is popular, because it
flatters men that they can decide anything offhand, by the
light of nature, or by some prompt application of assumptions
as to “natural rights,” or by applying the test of a
popular dogma or prejudice. It tramples study and
thought and culture under foot and turns their boasts to
scorn. On the other hand, it makes statesmanship impossible.
Study and thought go for nothing. There can
be no authority derived from information or science or
training, and no leadership won by virtue of these. If the
decision is to come from a popular vote, why not abandon
useless trouble and trust to that alone?</p>

<p>Such has been the outcome in history, as will appear
further on, of the doctrines which are associated with the
name of Jefferson, although they really had their origin in
the great social tendencies of the time and in the circumstances
of the American people. The love of philosophizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
about government was a feature in the life of the second
half of the eighteenth century. The method of philosophizing
on assumptions was the only one employed.
The Americans, with meager experience and high purposes,
readily took refuge in abstractions. The habit of pursuing
two or three occupations at once destroyed respect for
special or technical knowledge. There seemed to be nothing
unreasonable in referring a question of jurisprudence or international
law to merchants, farmers, and mechanics, for
them to give an opinion on it as a mere incident in their
regular occupations. Jefferson himself could sit down and
develop out of his own consciousness a plan for fortifications
and a navy, for a nation in imminent danger of war, with
no more misgivings, apparently, than if he was planning
an alteration on his estate.</p>

<p>“The further democracy was pushed, first in theory,
then in practice, the more completely was the belief in the
equality of all [in rights and privileges] converted, in the
minds of the masses, into the belief in the equal ability of
all to decide political questions of every kind. The principle
of mere numbers gradually supplanted the principle
of reflection and study.” This tendency reaches its climax
in the popular doctrines that every man has a right to his
opinion and that one man’s opinion is as good as another’s.
We have abundant illustration of the might which it gives
to “the phrase.”</p>

<p>It has been well said that “men can reason only from
what they know”—a doctrine which would reduce the
amount of reasoning to be done by anybody to a very
little. The common practice is to reason from what we
do not know, which makes every man a philosopher.</p>

<p>Jefferson’s election was the first triumph of the tendency
towards democracy—a triumph which has never yet been
reversed. The old conservatism of the former administrations
died out, and it is important to observe that, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
this time on, we have in conflict not the same two parties
as before, but only factions or subdivisions of the one party
which, under Washington and Adams, was in opposition
to the administration.</p>

<p>The event did not justify the fears which were entertained
before the election. Jefferson did not surrender
any of the power of the executive. He aggrandized it as
neither of his predecessors would have dared to do. He
did not surrender the central power in favor of states’
rights; and his foreign policy, governed by sympathy to
France and hatred to England, was only too sharp and
spirited. It seldom happens to an opposition party, coming
into power, to have the same question proposed to it
as to its predecessor, and to put its own policy to trial.
This happened to Jefferson. Jay’s Treaty was hesitatingly
signed by Washington, and it gave the country ten
years of peace and neutrality. Pinckney and Monroe’s
Treaty was rejected by Jefferson, and in six years the country
was engaged in a fruitless war.</p>

<p>Madison’s administration revived many of the social
usages which Jefferson had ostentatiously set aside, in
consistency with the general spirit of preference, on the
ground of republican simplicity, for what is common over
what is elegant and refined. The natural tendency of the
party in power to think that what is is right, and that
while they are comfortable other people ought to be so,
was apparent here. It went on so far during Madison’s
first term, that the leaders thought it necessary to break
the monotony and to secure again, in some way, the readiness
and activity of political life which had prevailed under
Jefferson. They forced Madison into the war with England—a
war which brought disturbance into the finances and
spread distress amongst the people, which won some glory
at sea only by vindicating the old Federalist policy in regard
to a navy, but which was marked by disaster on land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
until the battle of New Orleans. At the return of peace
in Europe, England was left free to deal with the United
States, and a peace was hastily made in which the question
of impressment, the only question at issue, was left just
where it had been at the beginning.</p>

<p>There ensued in our internal politics an “era of good
feeling.” The old parties no longer had any reason to
exist. Some of the Federal doctrines had been adopted.
The navy was secure in its popularity. The Federal financial
system had been adopted by the party in power. They
had contracted a debt, laid direct taxes, and enlisted armies.
When confronted by problems of war and debt, they had
found no better way to deal with them than the ways which
had been elaborated by the older nations, and which they
had blamed the Federalists for adopting. The questions of
neutrality had disappeared with the return of peace in
Europe. The fears of Jacobinism on the one hand and
of monarchy on the other were recognized as ridiculous. If,
however, any one is disposed to exaggerate the evils of
party, he ought to study the history of the era of good
feeling. Political issues were gone, but personal issues took
their place. Personal factions sprang up around each of
the prominent men who might aspire to the Presidency,
and, in their struggles to advance their favorites and destroy
their rivals, they introduced into politics a shameful series
of calumnies and personal scandals. Every candidate had
to defend himself from aspersions, from attacks based upon
his official or private life. The newspapers were loaded
down with controversies, letters, documents, and evidence
on these charges. The character of much of this matter
is such as to awaken disgust and ridicule. Mr. A. tells
Mr. B that, when in Washington, he was present at a dinner
at the house of Mr. C at which Mr. D said that he came
on in the stage with Mr. E, who told him that Mr. F had
seen a letter from Mr. G, a supposed friend of one candidate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
to Mr. H, the friend of another candidate, making
charges against the first candidate, which he (Mr. G) felt
bound in honor to make known. Mr. B publishes his information,
and then follow long letters from all the other
gentlemen, with explanations, denials, corroborative testimony,
and so on, in endless reiteration and confusion. It
was another noteworthy feature of this period, that every
public man seemed to stand ready to publish a “vindication”
at the slightest provocation, and that in these vindications
a confusion between character and reputation
appears to be universal.</p>

<p>These faction struggles culminated in the campaign of
1824. The first mention of General Jackson for the Presidency
seems to be in a letter from Aaron Burr to his son-in-law,
Alston of South Carolina, in 1815. An effort was
being made to form a party against the Virginia oligarchy.
Those who were engaged in it sought a candidate who
might be strong enough to secure success. Burr justified
his reputation as a politician by pointing out the man, but
it was yet too soon. The standard of what a Federal officer
ought to be was yet too high. The Albany Argus said of
the nomination, in 1824: “He [Jackson] is respected as a
gallant soldier, but he stands in the minds of the people of
this state at an immeasurable distance from the executive
chair.” The name of Jackson was used, however, in connection
with the Presidency, by various local conventions,
during 1822 and 1823; and, although the nomination was
generally met with indifference or contempt in the North
and East, it soon became apparent that he was the most
dangerous rival in the field. The nominations had hitherto
been made by caucuses of the members of Congress of
either party. Until Jefferson’s second nomination, these
had been held under a decent veil of secrecy. Since that
time they had exerted more and more complete and recognized
control. Crawford was marked for the succession,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
although he was under some discipline for having allowed
his name to be used in the caucus of 1816 against Monroe.
The opposing candidates now discovered that caucus nominations
were evil, and joined forces in a movement to put
an end to them. This movement gained popular approval
on general principles. When the caucus was called, naturally
only the friends of Crawford attended—sixty-six out
of two hundred and sixteen Republican members. The
nomination probably hurt him. It was proudly said that
King Caucus was now dethroned, but never was there a
greater mistake. He had only just come of age and escaped
from tutelage. He was about to enter on his inheritance.</p>

<p>General Jackson obtained the greatest number of votes
in the electoral college; and when the election came into
the House, a claim was loudly put forward which had been
feebly heard in 1801, that the House ought simply to carry
out the “will of the people” by electing him. This claim
distinctly raised the issue which has been described, of
democracy against the Constitution. Does the Constitution
give the election to the House in certain contingencies,
or does it simply charge it with the duty of changing a
plurality vote into an election? No one had a majority,
but the House was asked really to give to a major vote the
authority which, even on the democratic theory, belongs to
a majority.</p>

<p>The election could not but result in the discontent of
three candidates and their adherents, but the Jackson
party was by far the most discontented and most clamorous.
They proceeded to organize and labor for the next
campaign. They were shrewd, active men, who knew well
the arena and the science of the game. They offered to
Adams’s administration a ruthless and relentless opposition.
There were no great party issues; indeed, the country
was going through a period of profound peace and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
prosperity which offered little material for history and
little occasion for active political combat. The administration
was simple and businesslike and conducted the
affairs of the government with that smoothness and quiet
success which belong to the system in times of peace and
prosperity. Mr. Adams was urged to consolidate his party
by using the patronage of the executive, and the opinion
has been expressed that, if he had done so, he could have
won his reëlection. He steadfastly refused to do this.</p>

<p>The truth was that a new spirit had come over the
country, and that the candidacy of Jackson was the form
in which it was seeking admission into the Federal administration.
Here we meet with one of the great difficulties in
the study of American political history. The forces which
we find in action on the Federal arena have their origin in
the political struggles and personal jealousies of local politicians,
now in one state and now in another; and the
doctrines which are propounded at Washington, and come
before us in their maturity, have really grown up in the
states. Rotation in office began to be practiced in New
York and Pennsylvania at the beginning of the century.
The Federalists then lost power in those states, and their
political history consists of the struggles of factions in the
Republican party. Jefferson and Madison taught Democracy
in Virginia, but it never entered their heads that the
“low-down whites” were really to meddle in the formative
stage of politics. They expected that gentlemen planters
would meet and agree upon a distribution of offices, and
that then the masses should have the privilege of electing
the men they proposed. The Clintons and Livingstones in
New York were Democrats, but they likewise understood
that, in practice, they were to distribute offices around their
dinner-tables.</p>

<p>In the meantime men like Duane were writing essays for
farmers and mechanics, which were read from one end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
the Union to the other, in which they were preaching hostility
to banks and the “money power,” hostility to the
judiciary and to the introduction of the common law of
England, the election of judicial officers, rotation in office,
and all the dogmas which we generally ascribe to a much
later origin. These notions even found some practical applications,
as in the political impeachment of judges in
Pennsylvania in 1804—acts which fortunately did not
become precedents. The new constitutions which were
adopted from time to time during the first quarter of this
century show the slow working of this leaven, together with
the gradual adoption of improvements far less questionable.</p>

<p>After 1810 began also the series of great inventions which
have really opened this continent to mankind. The steamboat
was priceless to a country which had grand rivers but
scarcely any roads. In 1817 De Witt Clinton persuaded
New York to commence the Erie Canal, and before it was
finished scores of others were projected or begun. Politically
and financially the system of internal improvements
has proved disastrous, but those enterprises helped on the
events which we are now pursuing, for they assisted in
opening the resources of the continent to the reach of those
who had nothing. The great mass of the population found
themselves steadily gaining in property and comfort.
Their independence and self-reliance expanded. They developed
new traits of national character, and intensified
some of the old ones. They had full confidence in their
own powers, feared no difficulties, made light of experience,
were ready to deal offhand with any problems, laughed at
their own mistakes, despised science and study, overestimated
the practical man, and overesteemed material
good. To such a class the doctrines of democracy seemed
axiomatic, and they ascribed to democracy the benefits
which accrued to them as the first-comers in a new country.
They generally believed that the political system created<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
their prosperity; and they never perceived that the very
bountifulness of the new country, the simplicity of life, and
the general looseness of the social organism, allowed their
blunders to pass without the evil results which would have
followed in an older and denser community. The same
causes have produced similar results ever since.</p>

<p>Political machinery also underwent great development
during the first quarter of the century. In New York there
was perhaps the greatest amount of talent and skill employed
in this work, and the first engine used was the appointing
power. The opposing parties were only personal
and family factions, but they rigorously used power, when
they got it, to absorb honors and places. That conception
of office arose, under which it is regarded as a favor conferred
on the holder, not a position in which work is to be
done for the public service. Hence the office-holder sat
down to enjoy, instead of going to work to serve. If some
zealous man who took the latter view got into office, he
soon found that he could count upon being blamed for all
that went amiss, but would get little recognition or reward
while things went well, and that the safest policy was to
do nothing. The public was the worst paymaster and the
most exacting and unjust employer in the country, and it
got the worst service. The consequence was that the early
political history of New York is little more than a story of
the combinations and quarrels of factions, annual elections,
and lists of changes in the office-holders. The Clintons
and Livingstones united against Burr, who was the center
of an eager and active and ambitious coterie of young men,
who already threatened to apply democratic doctrines
with a consistency for which the aristocratic families were
not prepared. Then they began to struggle with each
other until the Livingstones were broken up. Then the
“Martling men” and the Clintonians, the Madisonians
and the Clintonians, the “Bucktails” and the Clintonians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
with various subdivisions, kept up the conflict until the
Constitution of 1821 altered the conditions of the fight,
and Regency and Anti-regency, or Regency and People’s
Party, or Regency and Workingmen’s Party became the
party headings. The net result of all this for national
politics was the production of a class of finished “politicians,”
skilled in all the work of “organization” which in
any wide democracy must be the first consideration. Some
of these gentlemen entered the national arena in 1824.
The Regency was then supporting Crawford as the regular
successor. On its own terms it could have been won for
Adams, but this arrangement was not brought about. It
did not require the astuteness of these men to see on reflection,
that Jackson was the coming man. He was in and of
the rising power. He represented a newer and more rigorous
application of the Jeffersonian dogmas. His manners,
tastes, and education, had nothing cold or aristocratic about
them. He had never been trained to aim at anything high,
elegant, and refined, and had not been spoiled by contact
with those who had developed the art of life. He had,
moreover, the great advantage of military glory. He had
bullied a judge, but he had won the battle of New Orleans.
He had hung a man against the verdict of a court-martial,
but the man was a British emissary. It was clear that a
tide was rising which would carry him into the Presidential
chair, and it behooved other ambitious men to cling to
his skirts and be carried up with him.</p>

<p>It is in and around the tariff of 1828 that the conflict
centers in which these various forces were combined or
neutralized to accomplish the result. The student of
our economic or political history cannot pay too close
study to that crisis. For the next fifteen years the financial
and political questions are inextricably interwoven.</p>

<p>The election of Jackson marks a new era in our political
history. A new order of men appeared in the Federal administration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
The whole force of local adherents of the
new administration, who had worked for it and therefore
had claims upon it, streamed to Washington to get their
reward. It seems that Jackson was forced by the rapacity
of this crowd into the “reformation” of the government.
The political customs which had grown up in New York
and Pennsylvania were transferred to Washington. Mr.
Marcy, in a speech in the Senate, January 24, 1832, on
Van Buren’s nomination as minister to England, boldly
stated the doctrine that to the victors belong the spoils,
avowing it as a doctrine which did not seem to him to call
for any delicacy on the part of politicians. In fact, to men
who had grown up as Mr. Marcy had, habit in this respect
must have made that doctrine seem natural and necessary
to the political system. The New York politicians had
developed an entire code of political morals for all branches
and members of the political party machine. They had
studied the passions, prejudices, and whims of bodies of
men. They had built up an organization in which all the
parts were adjusted to support and help one another. The
subordinate officers looked up to and sustained the party
leaders while carrying the party machinery into every nook
and corner of the state, and the party leaders in turn cared
for and protected their subordinates. Organization and
discipline were insisted upon throughout the party as the
first political duty. There is scarcely a phenomenon
more interesting to the social philosopher than to observe,
under a political system remarkable for its looseness and
lack of organization, the social bond returning and vindicating
itself in the form of party tyranny, and to observe
under a political system where loyalty and allegiance to
the Commonwealth are only names, how loyalty and allegiance
to party are intensified. It is one of the forms
under which the constant peril of the system presents itself,
namely, that a part may organize to use the whole for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
narrow and selfish ends. The idea of the commonwealth
is lost and the public arena seems only a scrambling-ground
for selfish cliques. In the especial case of the New
York factions, this was all intensified by the fact that there
were no dignified issues, no real questions of public policy
at stake, but only factions of the ins and the outs,
struggling for the spoils of office. Naturally enough, the
contestants thought that to the victors belong the spoils—otherwise
the contest had no sense at all. In this system,
now, fidelity to a caucus was professed and enforced. Bolting,
or running against a regular nomination, were high
crimes which were rarely condoned. On the other hand,
the leaders professed the doctrine that a man who surrendered
his claims for the good of the party, or who stood
by the party, must never be allowed to suffer for it. The
same doctrines had been accepted more or less at Washington,
but in a feeble and timid way. From this time they grew
into firm recognition. Under their operation politics became
a trade. The public officer was, of necessity, a politician, and
the work by which he lived was not service in his official duty,
but political party labor. The tenure of office was so insecure
and the pay so meager, that few men of suitable
ability could be found who did not think that they could
earn their living more easily, pleasantly, and honorably in
some other career. Public service gravitated downwards
to the hands of those who, under the circumstances, were
willing to take it. It presented some great prizes in the
form of collectorships, etc., the remuneration for which
was in glaring contrast with the salaries of some of the
highest and most responsible officers in the government;
but, for the most part, the public service fell into the hands
of men who were exposed to the temptation to make it pay.</p>

<p>After the general onslaught on the caucus, in 1824, it fell
into disuse as a means of nominating state officers, and
conventions took its place. At first sight this seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
be a more complete fulfillment of the democratic idea. The
people were to meet and act on their own motion. It was
soon found, however, that the only change was in the necessity
for higher organization. In the thirties there was indeed
a fulfillment of the theory which seems now to have passed
away; there was a spontaneity and readiness in assembling
and organizing common action which no longer exists;
there was a public interest and activity far beyond what is
now observable. One is astonished at the slight occasion
on which meetings were held, high excitement developed,
and energetic action inaugurated. The anti-Masonic movement,
from 1826 to 1832, is a good instance. The “Liberty
party” (Abolitionists), the “Native Americans,” the “Anti-renters,”
all bear witness to a facility of association which
certainly does not now exist. It is, however, an indispensable
prerequisite to the pure operation of the machinery
of caucus and convention. The effort to combine all good
men has been talked about from the beginning, but it has always
failed on account of the lack of a bond between them
as strong as the bond of interest which unites the factions.</p>

<p>During the decade from 1830 to 1840 a whole new set of
machinery was created to fit the new arrangements. This
consisted in committees, caucuses, and conventions, ramifying
down finally into the wards of great cities, and guided
and handled by astute and experienced men. Under their
control the initiative of “the people” died out. The public
saw men elected whom they had never chosen, and measures
adopted which they had never desired, and themselves, in
short, made the sport of a system which cajoled and flattered
while it cheated them. If a governor had been elected
by some political trickery a little more flagrant than usual,
he was very apt, in his inaugural, to draw a dark picture of
the effete monarchies of the Old World, and to congratulate
the people on the blessings they enjoyed in being able
to choose their own rulers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>This period was full of new energy and turbulent life.
Railroads were just beginning to carry on the extension of
production which steamboats and canals had begun. Immigration
was rapidly increasing. The application of anthracite
coal to the arts was working a revolution in them.
On every side reigned the greatest activity. Literature
and science, which before had had but a meager existence,
were coming into life. The public journals, which had
formerly been organs of persons and factions, or substitutes
for books, now began to be transformed into the
modern newspaper. The difficulties and problems presented
by all this new life were indeed great, and the
tasks of government, as well to discriminate between what
belonged to it and what did not, as to do what did belong
to it, were great. On the general principles of the Democratic
party of the day in regard to the province of government,
history has already passed the verdict that they
were sound and correct. On the main questions which
divided the administration and the opposition, it must pass
a verdict in favor of the administration. These issues
were not indeed clear and the parties did not, as is generally
supposed, take sides upon them definitely. Free trade,
so far as it was represented by the compromise tariff, was
the result of a coalition between Clay and Calhoun against
the administration, after Calhoun’s quarrel with Jackson
had led the latter to revoke the understanding in accordance
with which Calhoun retired from the contest of 1824
and took the second place. The South was now in the
position in which the northeastern states had found themselves
at the beginning of the century. The Southerners
considered that the tariff of 1828 had subjected their interests
to those of another section which held a majority
in the general government, and that the Union was
being used only as a means of so subjecting them.
They seized upon the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
of 1798, which Jefferson and Madison had drawn when in
opposition, as furnishing them a ground of resistance, and
threw into the tariff question no less a stake than civil war
and disunion. On this issue there were no parties. South
Carolina stood alone.</p>

<p>Banks had been political questions in the states and in
the general government from the outset. The history of
Pennsylvania and New York furnishes some great scandals
under this head. From time to time, the methods of banking
employed had called down the condemnation of the most
conservative and sensible men, and had aroused some
less well-balanced of judgment to indiscriminate hostility.
Jackson’s attack on the Bank of the United States sprang
from a political motive, and he proposed instead of it a
bank on the “credit and revenues of the government”—a
proposition too vague to be understood, but which suggested
a grand paper-machine, at a time when the Bank
of the United States was at its best. This attack rallied
to itself at once all the local banks; the great victory
of 1832 was not a victory for hard money so much as it
was a victory of the state banks over the national bank.
The removal of the deposits was a reckless financial step,
and the crash of 1837 was its direct result.</p>

<p>The traditional position of the Democratic party on
hard money has another source. In 1835 a party sprang
up in New York City, as a faction of Tammany, which took
the name of the “Equal Rights party,” but which soon
received the name of the “Locofoco party” from an incident
which occurred at Tammany Hall, and which is significant
of the sharpness of party tactics at the time. This
party was a radical movement inside of the administration
party. It claimed, and justly enough, that it had returned
to the Jeffersonian fountain and drawn deeper and purer
waters than the Jacksonian Democrats. It demanded
equality with a new energy, and in its denunciations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
monopolies and banks went very close to the rights of
property. It demanded that all charters should be repealable,
urgently favored a metallic currency, resisted the
application of English precedents in law courts and legislatures,
and desired an elective judiciary. It lasted as a
separate party only five or six years, and then was cajoled
out of existence by superior political tactics; but it was not
without reason that the name spread to the whole party,
for, laying aside certain extravagances, two or three of its
chief features soon came to be adopted by the Democrats.</p>

<p>On the great measures of public policy, therefore, the
position of the administration was not clear and thorough,
but the tendency was in the right direction, especially when
contrasted with the policy urged by the Whigs. In regard
to internal improvements, the administration early
took up a position which the result fully justified, and in
its opposition to the distribution of the surplus revenue its
position was unassailable. In its practical administration
of the government there is less ground for satisfaction in
the retrospect. Besides the general lowering of tone which
has been mentioned, there were scandals and abuses which
it is not necessary to specify. General Jackson’s first
cabinet fell to pieces suddenly, under the effect of a private
scandal and of the President’s attempt to coerce the private
social tastes of his cabinet, or rather of their wives. He
held to the doctrine of popularity, and its natural effect
upon a man of his temper, without the sobriety of training
and culture, was to stimulate him to lawless self-will.
He regarded himself as the chosen representative of the
whole people, charged, as such, with peculiar duties over
against Congress. The “will of the people” here received
a new extension. He found it in himself, and what he
found there he did not hesitate to set in opposition to the
will of the people as this found expression through their constitutional
organs. At the same time the practice of “instructions”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
marked an extension, on another side, of the
general tendency to bring public action closer under the
control of changing majorities.</p>

<p>Van Buren’s election was a triumph of the caucus and
convention, which had now been reduced to scarcely less
exactitude of action than the old congressional caucus. Van
Buren, however, showed more principle than had been expected
from his reputation. He had to bear all the blame for
the evil fruits resulting from the mistakes made during the
last eight years. Moving with the radical or Locofoco tendency,
he attempted to sever bank and state by the independent
treasury, and in so doing he lost the support of the
“Bank Democrats.” This, together with the natural political
revulsion after a financial crisis, lost him his re-election.</p>

<p>The Whig party was rich in able men, which makes it
the more astonishing that one cannot find, in their political
doctrines, a sound policy of government. The national
bank may still be regarded as an open question, and favoring
the bank was not favoring inconvertible paper money;
but their policy of high tariff for protection, of internal improvements,
and of distribution of the surplus revenue, has
been calamitous so far as it has been tried. They also
present the same lack of political sagacity which we have
remarked in the Federalists, whose successors in general
they were. They oscillated between principle and expediency
in such a way as to get the advantages of neither;
and they abandoned their best men for available men at
just such times as to throw away all their advantages. The
campaign of 1840 presents a pitiful story. There are
features in it which are almost tragic. An opportunity for
success offering, a man was chosen who had no marks of
eminence and no ability for the position. His selection
bears witness to an anxious search for a military hero. It
resulted in finding one whose glory had to be exhumed from
the doubtful tradition of a border Indian war. The campaign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
was marked by the introduction of mass meetings
and systematic stump-speaking, and by the erection of
“log-cabins,” which generally served as barrooms for the
assembled crowd, so that many a man who went to a
drunkard’s grave twenty or thirty years ago dated his ruin
from the “hard-cider campaign.” After the election it
proved that hungry Whigs could imitate the Democrats of
1829 in their clamor for office, and, if anything, better the
instruction. The President’s death was charged partly to
worry and fatigue. It left Mr. Tyler President, and the
question then arose what Mr. Tyler was—a question to
which the convention at Harrisburg, fatigued with the
choice between Clay and Harrison, had not given much
attention. It was found that he was such that the Whig
victory turned to ashes. No bank was possible, no distribution
was possible, and only a tariff which was lame
and feeble from the Whig point of view. The cabinet
resigned, leaving Mr. Webster alone at his post. In vain,
like a true statesman, he urged the Whigs to rule with
Mr. Tyler, since they had got him and could not get rid
of him or get anybody else. Like a true statesman, again,
he remained at his post, in spite of misrepresentation, until
he could finish the English treaty, and it was another feature
of the story that he lost position with his party by so
doing. The system did not allow Mr. Webster the highest
reward of a statesman, to plan and mold measures so as
to impress himself on the history of his country. It allowed
him only the work of reducing to a minimum the
harm which other people’s measures were likely to do. In
the circumstances of the time war with England was imminent,
and there was good reason for fear if the negotiation
were to fall into the hands of the men whom Mr. Tyler
was gathering about him. The Whigs were broken and
discouraged, and as their discipline had always been far
looser than that of their adversaries, they seemed threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
with disintegration. The other party, however, was divided
by local issues and broken into factions. Its discipline
had suffered injury, and its old leaders had lost
their fire while new ones had not arisen to take their places.
The western states were growing into a size and influence in
the confederation which made it impossible for two or three
of the old states to control national politics any longer.</p>

<p>In this state of things the southern leaders came forward
to give impetus and direction to the national administration.
They had, what the southern politicians
always had, leisure for conference. They had also character
and social position, and a code of honor which enabled
them to rely on one another without any especial
bond of interest other than the general one. They had
such a bond, common and complete, in their stake in
slavery. They could count, without doubt or danger, on
support throughout their entire section. They had a fixed
program also, which was an immense advantage for entering
on the control of a mass of men under no especial
impetus. They had besides their traditional alliance with the
Democrats of the North—an alliance which always was
unnatural and illogical, and which now turned to the perversion
of that party. They prepared their principles,
doctrines, and constitutional theories to fit their plans.</p>

<p>Difficulties with Mexico in regard to Texas had arisen
during Jackson’s administration. These difficulties seemed
to be gratuitous and unjust on the part of the United States,
and they seemed to be nursed by the same power. The
diplomatic correspondence on this affair is not pleasant
reading to one who would see his country honorable and
upright, as unwilling to bully as to be bullied. Such was
not the position of the United States in this matter.</p>

<p>It was determined by the southern leaders to annex
Texas to the United States, and to this end they seized
upon the political machinery and proceeded to employ it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<p>The election of Polk is another of the points to which the
student of American politics should give careful attention.
The intrigues which surrounded it have never been more
than partially laid bare, but, if fairly studied, they give
deep insight into the nature of the forces which operate
in the name of the will of the people. The slavery issue
was here introduced into American politics; and when that
question was once raised, it “could not be settled until it
was settled right.” For ten years efforts were made to
keep the issue out of politics and to prevent parties from
dividing upon it. What was desired was that the old
parties should stand in name and organization, in order
that they might be used, while the actual purposes were
obtained by subordinate means. A party with an organization
and discipline, and a history such as the Democratic
party had in 1844, is a valuable property. It is like a well-trained
and docile animal which will go through the appointed
tasks at the given signal. It disturbs the discipline
to introduce new watchwords and to depart from the routine,
in order to use reason instead of habit. Hence the effort
is to reduce the new and important issues to subordinate
places, to carry them incidentally, while the old commonplaces
hold together the organization. It is safe to say,
however, that, in the long run, the true issues are sure to
become the actual issues, and that delay and deceit only
intensify the conflict.</p>

<p>Upon Polk’s election the independent treasury and comparative
free trade were fixed in the policy of the government
for fifteen years, with such beneficial results as to
render them the proudest traditions of the party which
adopted them.</p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun had abandoned the opposition during Van
Buren’s administration, and had begun to form and lead
the southern movement. His own mind moved too rapidly
for his adherents, and he could not bring them to support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
him up to the positions which he considered it necessary
to take; but, even as it was, the steps of the southern
program came out with a rapidity, and were of a character,
to shock the imperfectly prepared northern allies. The
Democratic party of the North was not a proslavery party.
Whigs and Democrats at the North united in frowning
down Abolition excitements, and in maintaining the compromises
of the Constitution. Old-line Whigs and hunker
Democrats agreed in the conservatism which resisted the
introduction of this question; but when, in 1844, Van
Buren was asked, as a test question to a candidate, whether
he would favor the annexation of Texas, the subject of
slavery in the territories was thrown into the political
arena from the southern side. It was not then a question
of abolishing slavery in the southern states, which could
not have obtained discussion except in irresponsible newspapers
and on irresponsible platforms. It was not a question
of spreading slavery into the old territories, for Texas
and the Indian Territory barred the way to all which the
Missouri Compromise left open. It was now a question of
taking or buying or conquering new territory for slavery,
and every one knew well that the chief reason for the revolt
of Texas was that Mexico had abolished slavery. The
South indeed claimed to have suffered aggressions and encroachments
in regard to slavery ever since the adoption
of the Constitution, and the attempt was now to be made
to secure recompense. In the form in which the proposition
came up it was no slight shock to those who had always
been in alliance with the South. Party men like Van Buren
and Benton drew back. Southerners like Clay resisted.
The actual clash of arms, fraudulently brought about and
speciously misrepresented, put an end to discussion, and
aroused a war fever under the pernicious motto, “Our
country, right or wrong.” If we are a free people and
govern ourselves, our country is ourselves, and we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
no guaranty of right and injustice if we throw those standards
behind us the moment we have done wrong enough
to find ourselves at war. The war ended, moreover, in an
acquisition of territory, which, of course, was popular;
and it proved that this territory was rich in precious metals,
which added to the popular estimate of it. The antecedents
of the war were forgotten.</p>

<p>Its political results, however, were far more important.
Calhoun now came forward to ward off a long conflict in
regard to slavery in these territories, by the new doctrine
that the Constitution extended to all the national domain,
and carried slavery with it—a doctrine which his followers
did not, for ten years afterwards, dare to take up
and rigorously apply, and which divided the Democratic
party of the North. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise
and the enactment of the Fugitive Slave Law were
only steps in the conflict which was as yet confused, but
which was clearing itself for a crisis. The South, like every
clamorous suitor, reckless of consequences, obtained wide
concessions from an adversary who sought peace and contentment,
and who saw clearly the dangers of a struggle
outside the limits of constitution and law.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The Abolitionists, from their first organization, pursued
an “irreconcilable” course. They refused to vote for any
slaveholder, or for any one who would vote for a slaveholder,
and refused all alliances which involved any concession
whatever. They more than once, by this course,
aided the party most hostile to them, and, in the view of
the ordinary politician, were guilty of great folly. They
showed, however, what is the power of a body which has
a principle and has no ambition, and is content to remain
in a minority. Probably if the South had been more moderate,
the Abolitionists would have attracted little more
notice than a fanatical religious sect; but, as events marched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
on, they came to stand as the leaders in the greatest political
movement of our history. The refusal of the Whig
Convention of 1848 to adopt an antislavery resolution, and
the great acts above mentioned, together with the popular
reaction against a party which, if it had had its way, would
never have won the grand territories on the Pacific, destroyed
the Whig party. The party managers, enraged at
the immense foreign element which they saw added year
by year to their adversaries, forming a cohort, as it appeared,
especially amenable to party discipline and the
dictation of party managers, took up the Native American
movement, which had had some existence ever since
the great tide of immigration set in. The effort was
wrecked on the obvious economic follies involved in it.
How could a new country set hindrances against the immigration
of labor? Politically, the effect was great in confirming
the allegiance of naturalized voters, as a mass, to
the Democratic party as the party which would protect
their political privileges against malicious attacks. The
formation of the Free-Soil party or its development into
the Republican party, brought the extension of slavery
into the territories, and the extension of its influence in
the administration of the government, distinctly forward
as the controlling political issue.</p>

<p>On this issue the Democratic party, as a political organization,
made up traditionally of the southern element
which has been described, of so much of the old northern
Democratic party as had not been repelled by the recent
advances in Southern demands, and of the large body of
immigrants who regarded that party as the poor man’s
and the immigrant’s friend, fell out of the place it had occupied
as the representative of the great democratic tide
which flows through and forms our political history. This
movement has been in favor of equality. It has borne
down and obliterated all the traditions and prejudices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
which were inherited from the Old World. It has eliminated
from our history almost all recollection of the old
Federal party, with its ideas of social and political leadership.
It has crushed out the prestige of wealth and education
in politics. It has, by narrow tenures, and by cutting
away all terms of language and ceremonial observances
tending to mark official rank, restrained the respect and
authority due to office. The Northern hatred of slavery in the
later days was due more to the feeling that it was undemocratic
than to the feeling that it was immoral. It was always
an anomaly that the Virginians should be democrats
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>, and should regard the yeomen farmers of
New England as aristocrats, when, on any correct definitions
or standards, the New England States were certainly
the most democratic commonwealths in the world. Slavery
was an obvious bar to any such classification; and when
slavery became a political issue, the parties found their consistent
and logical position. The rise and victory of the
Republican party was only a continuation of the same
grand movement for equality. The old disputes between
Federalists and Jeffersonians had ended in such a complete
victory for the latter, that the rising generation would have
enumerated the Jeffersonian doctrines as axioms or definitions
of American institutions. Every schoolboy could
dogmatize about natural and inalienable rights, about the
conditions under which men are created, about the rights
of the majority, and about liberty. The same doctrines
are so held to-day by the mass of the people, and they are
held so implicitly that corollaries are deduced from them
with a more fearless logic than is employed upon political
questions anywhere else in the world. Even scholars and
philosophers who reflect upon them and doubt them are
slow to express their dissent, so jealous and quick is the
popular judgment of an attempt upon them. The Democratic
party of the fifties was, therefore, false to its fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
principle of equality when it followed its alliance
with the South and allowed itself to be carried against
equality for negroes. Whether there were not subtle principles
of human nature at work is a question too far-reaching
to be followed here.</p>

<p>With the rise of the Republican party there came new
elements into American politics. The question at stake
was moral in form. It enlisted unselfish and moral and
religious motives. It reached outside the proper domain
of politics—the expedient measures to be adopted for
ends recognized as desirable—and involved justice and
right in regard to the ends. It enlisted, therefore, heroic
elements: sacrifice for moral good, and devotion to right
in spite of expediency. At the same time, the issue was
clear, simple, single, and distinct. The organization upon
it was close and harmonious, not on account of party discipline,
but on account of actual concord in motive and
purpose. The American system was here seen in many
respects at its best, and it worked more nearly up to its
theoretical results in the election of Lincoln, a thoroughly
representative man out of the heart of the majority, than
in any other election in our history. It is probably the recollection
and the standard of this state of things which leads
men now on the stage to believe that corruption is spreading
and that the political system is degenerating. It is
one of the peculiarities of the government of the United
States, that it has little historical continuity. If it had
more, or if people had more knowledge of their own political
history, the above-mentioned opinion would find little
ground. The student of history who goes back searching
for the golden age does not find it.</p>

<p>All the heroic elements in the political issue of 1860 were,
of course, intensified by the war. There was the consciousness
of patriotic sacrifice in submitting to loss, bloodshed,
and taxation for the sake of an idea, for the further extension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
of political blessings long enjoyed and highly esteemed.
After the war, national pride and consciousness of power
expanded naturally, but the questions which then arose
were of a different order. They were properly political
questions. They concerned taxation, finance, the reconstruction
of the South, the status of the freedmen. The war
fervor, or the moral fervor of the political contest, could
not remain at the former high pitch. There followed a
natural reaction. Questions which touched the results of
the war brought a quick and eager response. It would
not be in human nature that that response should not be
tinged by hatred of rebels and by the worse passions
which war arouses. For war is at best but a barbarous
makeshift for deciding political questions. Let them
be never so high and pure in their moral aspects, war
drags them down into contact with the lowest and basest
passions—with cruelty, rapacity, and revenge. Moreover,
it was natural that people should want rest and
quiet after the anxiety and excitement of war. Every
householder desired to enjoy in peace the political system
which he had defended and established by war; he did
not care to renew the excitement on the political arena.
The questions which arose were no longer such as could
be decided by reference to a general political dogma or
a moral principle or a text of Scripture. They were such
as to perplex and baffle the wisest constitutional lawyer
or the ablest financier or the wisest statesman. The indifference
and apathy which ensued were remarkable, and
they probably had still other causes. The last twenty-five
years have seen immense additions to the number and
variety of subjects which claim a share of the interest and
attention of intelligent men. Literature has taken an
entirely new extension and form. Newspapers bring daily
information of the political and social events of a half-dozen
civilized countries. New sciences appeal to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
interest of the entire community. Educational, ecclesiastical,
sanitary, and economic undertakings, in which the
public welfare is involved, demand a part of the time and
effort of every citizen. At the same time trade and industry
have undergone such changes in form and method that
success in them demands far closer and more exclusive
application than formerly. The social organization is
becoming more complex, the division of labor is necessarily
more refined, and the value of expert ability is rapidly rising.</p>

<p>It follows from all this that, while public interests are
becoming broader and weightier, the ability of the average
voter to cope with them is declining. It is no wonder that
we have not the political activity of the first half of this
century. Instead of grasping at the right to a share in
deciding, we shrink from the responsibility. We are more
inclined to do here what we should do in any other affair—seek
for competently trained hands into which to commit
the charge. The frequent elections, instead of affording
a pleasurable interest to the ordinary voter, appear
to be tiresome interruptions. What he wants is good government,
honorable and efficient administration, businesslike
permanence, and exactitude. He recognizes in the
short terms and continual elections, not an opportunity
for him to control the government, but an opportunity for
professional hangers-on of parties to make a living, and a
continually recurring opportunity for schemers of various
grades to enter and carry out their plans when people are
too busy to watch them. The opinion seems to be gaining
ground that, for fear of power, we have eliminated both
efficiency and responsibility; that if power is united with
responsibility, it will be timid and reluctant enough; and
that the voter needs only reserve the right of supervision
and interference from time to time. The later state constitutions
show a reaction from those of the first half of
the century in the length of terms of office, and in the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
tendency of the people to take guaranties against
themselves or their representatives. There seems also to
be a tendency to investigate the theory of appointments
or elections to office as a means of devising measures more
satisfactory to that end. No system will ever give a self-governing
people a government which is better than they
can appreciate; but the very belief, to which we have before
referred, that the government is degenerating, is the best
proof that the public standards as to the <em>personnel</em> and the
methods of the government are rising. It seems to be perceived
that the plan of popular selection is applicable to
executive and legislative officers, but that it is not applicable
to the judiciary or to administrative officers. In the
one case, broad questions of policy control the choice; in
the other case, personal qualifications and technical training,
in regard to which the mass of voters cannot be
informed and cannot judge. In some quarters, an unfortunate
effort has been made to charge the duty of making
certain appointments upon the judges, because, as a class,
they retain the greatest popular confidence and because
the restraints of their position are the weightiest. This, however,
seems to be using up our last reserves. There has been
abundant criticism of political movements and circumstances
of late years. At first sight, it does not appear to
be very fruitful. People seem to pay as little heed to it as
devout Catholics do to the asserted corruptions of the
Church; but other and deeper signs point to a conservative
movement, slow, as all popular movements must be,
but nevertheless real.</p>

<p>The political party system which had been developed
previous to the war underwent no change during the heroic
period. The doctrines of spoils and of rotation in office
were indeed condemned, but it appeared (as it must appear
to any new party coming into office) that the interests at
stake were too great to be risked by leaving any part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
the administration in the hands of disaffected men, and,
with some apologies, the changes were made. It is the
fate of the party in power to draw to itself all the unprincipled
men who seek to live by politics, and to lose its principled
adherents as, on one question after another, they
disapprove of its action. The moral and heroic doctrines
or sentiments of the Republican party were just the political
principles which offered the best chance to the unprincipled.
A man of corrupt character could “hate slavery” when
that was the line of popularity and success, and could be
“loyal” when only loyal men could get offices. The political
machinery whose growth has been traced was adopted
by the new party as a practical necessity, and the men
“inside politics” still teach the old code wrought out by
Tammany Hall and the Albany Regency, not only as the
only rules of success for the ambitious politician, but also as
the only sound theories on which the Republic can be governed.
In those quarters where hitherto the refinements
of the system have all been invented, a new and ominous
development has recently appeared in the shape of the
“Boss.” He is the last and perfect flower of the long development
at which hundreds of skilful and crafty men
have labored, and into which the American people have put
by far the greatest part of their political energy. It has
been observed that the discipline or coercion which we
dread for national purposes and under constitutional forms
appears with the vigor of a military despotism in party;
and that the conception of loyalty, for which we can find
no proper object in our system, is fully developed in the
party. Under this last development, also, we find leadership,
aristocratic authority of the ablest, nay, even the
monarchical control of the party king. He is a dictator
out of office. He has power, without the annoyance or
restraints of office. He is the product of a long process of
natural selection. He has arisen from the ranks, has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
tried by various tests, has been trained in subordinate
positions, and has come up by steady promotions—all
the processes which, when we try to get them into the
public service, we are told are visionary and aristocratic.
With the now elaborate system of committees rising in a
hierarchy from the ward to the nation, with the elaborate
system of primaries, nominating committees, caucuses, and
conventions, not one citizen in a thousand could tell the
process by which a city clerk is elected. It becomes a
special trade to watch over and manage these things, and
the power which rules is not the “will of the people,” but
the address with which “slates” are made up. Organization
is the secret by which the branches of the political
machinery are manipulated, when they are not, by various
devices, reduced, as in the larger cities, to mere forms.
In these cases the ring and the “Boss” are the natural outcome.
Any one who gets control of the machine can run
it to produce what he desires, with the exception, perhaps,
that if he should try to make it produce good, he might
find that this involved a reverse action of the entire
mechanism, under which it would break to pieces. These
developments are as yet local, for the plunder of a great
city is a prize not to be abandoned for any temptation
which the general government can offer. In some cases
they are hostile to the power of the Federal office-holders
where that is greatest and most dangerous, so that they
neutralize each other. At the same time some of the Federal
legislation in the way of “protection” and subsidies
offers high inducements and abundant opportunities for
debauching the public service. There are afforded by the
system in great abundance means of rewarding adherents,
distributing largess, collecting campaign funds, and performing
favors; and it tends to bind men together in cliques
up and down through the service, on the basis of mutual
assistance and support and protection. Suppose that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
ring and the “Boss” should ever be ingrafted upon this
system!</p>

<p>It cannot be regarded as a healthful sign that such a
state of things creates only a laugh or a groan of disgust
or at best a critical essay. It seems sometimes as if the
prophecy of Calhoun had turned into history: “When it
comes to be once understood that politics is a game, that
those who are engaged in it but act a part, and that they
make this or that profession, not from honest conviction
or an intent to fulfil them, but as a means of deluding the
people, and, through that delusion, acquiring power,—when
such professions are to be entirely forgotten, the
people will lose all confidence in public men. All will be
regarded as mere jugglers, the honest and patriotic as well
as the cunning and profligate, and the people will become
indifferent and passive to the grossest abuses of power, on
the ground that those whom they may elevate, under whatever
pledges, instead of reforming, will but imitate the
example of those whom they have expelled.”</p>

<p>In the final extension of the conception of the “will of
the people,” and of the position of Congress in relation to
it, Congress has come to be timid and faltering in the face
of difficult tasks. It knows how to go when the people
have spoken, and not otherwise. The politician gets his
opinions from the elections, and the legislature wants to
be pushed, even in reference to matters which demand
promptitude and energy. Statesmanship has no positive
field and has greatly declined. The number of able men
who formerly gave their services to mold, correct, and
hinder legislation, and upon whom the responsibility for
leading on doubtful and difficult measures could be thrown,
has greatly decreased. The absence of “leaders” has often
been noticed. The fact seems to be that able men have
observed that such statesmen as have been described bore
the brunt of the hard work, and were held responsible for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
what they had done their best to hinder; that they cherished
a vain hope and ambition their whole lives long, and
saw inferior men without talent or industry preferred before
them. It is a sad thing to observe the tone adopted
towards a mere member of Congress as such. When one
reflects that he is a member of the grand legislature of the
nation, it is no gratifying sign of the times that he should
be regarded without respect, that a slur upon his honor
should be met as presumptively just, and that boys should
turn flippant jests upon the office, as if it involved a dubious
reputation. If the Republic possesses the power to
meet and conquer its own tasks, it cannot too soon take
measures to secure a representative body which shall respect
itself and be respected, without doubt or question,
both at home and abroad; for the times have changed and
the questions have changed, and we can no longer afford
to govern ourselves by means of the small men. The interests
are now too vast and complex, and the greatest
question now impending, the currency, contains too vast
possibilities of mischief to this entire generation to be left
the sport of incompetents. The democratic Republic
exults in the fact that it has, against the expectations of
its enemies, conducted a great civil war to a successful
result. A far heavier strain on democratic-republican self-government
lies in the questions now impending: can
we ward off subsidy-schemers? can we correct administrative
abuses? can we purify the machinery of elections? can
we revise erroneous financial systems and construct sound
ones? The war appealed to the simplest and commonest
instincts of human nature, especially as human nature is
developed under democratic institutions. The questions
before us demand for their solution high intellectual power
and training, great moderation and self-control, and perhaps
no less disposition to endure sacrifices than did the
war itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<p>Such a review as has here been given of the century of
American politics must raise the question as to whether the
course has been upward or downward, and whether the
experiment is a success or not. On such questions opinions
might fairly differ, and I prefer to express upon them only
an individual opinion.</p>

<p>The Federal political system, such as it is historically in
the intention and act of its framers, seems to me open to
no objection whatever, and to be the only one consistent
with the circumstances of the case. I have pursued here a
severe and exact criticism of its history, as the only course
consistent with the task before me, and the picture may
seem dark and ungratifying. I know of no political history
which, if treated in the same unsparing way, would appear
much better. I find nothing in our history to throw doubt
upon the feasibility and practical advantage of a constitutional
Republic. That system, however, assumes and imperatively
requires high intelligence, great political sense,
self-sacrificing activity, moderation, and self-control on the
part of the citizens. It is emphatically a system for sober-minded
men. It demands that manliness and breadth of
view which consider all the factors in a question, submit
to no sophistry, never cling to a detail or an objection or
a side issue to the loss of the main point, and, above all,
which can measure a present advantage against a future
loss, and individual interest against the common good.
These requirements need only be mentioned to show that
they are so high that it is no wonder we should have fallen
short of them in our history. The task of history is to show
us wherein and why, so that we may do better in future.</p>

<p>If the above sketch of our political history has been
presented with any success, it shows the judgment which
has been impressed upon my mind by the study of it,
namely, that the tenor of the Constitution has undergone
a steady remolding in history in the direction of democracy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
If a written constitution were hedged about by all
the interpretations conceivable, until it were as large as
the Talmud, it could not be protected from the historical
process which makes it a different thing to one generation
from what it is to another, according to the uses and needs
of each. I have mentioned the forces which seem to me
to produce democracy here. They are material and physical,
and there is no fighting against them. It is, however,
in my judgment, a corruption of democracy to set up the
dogma that all men are equally competent to give judgment
on political questions; and it is a still worse perversion
of it to adopt the practical rule that they must be
called upon to exercise this ability on all questions as the
regular process for getting those questions solved. The
dogma is false, and the practical rule is absurd. Caucus
and wire-pulling and all the other abuses are only parasites
which grow upon these errors.</p>

<p>Reform does not seem to me to lie in restricting the
suffrage or in other arbitrary measures of a revolutionary
nature. They are impossible, if they were desirable. Experience
is the only teacher whose authority is admitted in this
school, and I look to experience to teach us all that the
power of election must be used to select competent men to
deal with questions, and not to indirectly decide the questions
themselves. I expect that this experience will be very
painful, and I expect it very soon.</p>

<p>On the question whether we are degenerating or not, I
have already suggested my opinion that we are not degenerating.
The lamentations on that subject have never
been silent. It seems to me that, taking the whole community
through, the tone is rising and the standard is advancing,
and that this is one great reason why the system
seems to be degenerating. Existing legislation nourishes
and produces some startling scandals, which have great
effect on people’s minds. The same legislation has demoralized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
the people, and perverted their ideas of the
functions of government even in the details of town and
ward interests. The political machinery also has been refined
and perfected until it totally defeats the popular will,
and has produced a kind of despair in regard to any effort
to recover that of which the people have been robbed; but
I think that it would be a great mistake to suppose that
there are not, behind all this, quite as high political standards
and as sound a public will as ever before. An obvious
distinction must be made here between the administration
of the government, or the methods of party politics, and
the general political morale of the people. Great scandals
are quickly forgotten, and there are only too many of them
throughout our history. Party methods have certainly become
worse and worse. The public service has certainly
deteriorated; but I should judge that the political will of
the nation never was purer than it is to-day. That will
needs instruction and guidance. It is instructed only
slowly and by great effort, especially through literary
efforts, because it has learned distrust. It lacks organization,
and its efforts are spasmodic and clumsy. The proofs
of its existence are not very definite or specific, and any one
in expressing a judgment must be influenced by the circle
with which he is most familiar; but there are some public
signs of it, which are the best encouragement we have
to-day.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">You</span> must have observed that the social sciences,
including politics and political economy, are the
favorite arena of those who would like to engage in learned
discussion without overmuch trouble in the way of preparation.
I doubt not that you have also been struck by the
fact that these sciences are now the refuge of the conceited
dogmatism which has been expelled from the physical sciences.
It follows that the discussions in social science are
the widest, the most vague, the most imperative in form of
statement, the most satisfactory to the writers, the least
convincing to everybody else; and that the social sciences
make very little progress. The harm does not all come
from the amateurs and volunteers who meddle in these
subjects. It comes also from false methods and want of
training on the part of those of higher pretensions. If,
however, the methods which have hitherto been pursued
are correct, if any one is able without previous care or study
to strike out the solution of a difficult social problem, for
which solution, however, he can give no guarantee to anybody
else, then the social sciences are given over to endless
and contemptible wrangling, and are unworthy of the time
and attention of sober men. Such, however, is not the case.
The Science of Life, which teaches us how to live together
in human society, and has more to do with our happiness
here than any other science, is not a mere structure of
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> whims. It is not a mass of guesses which the
guesser tries to render plausible. It is not a tangle of dogmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
which are incapable of verification. It is not a bundle
of sentiments and enthusiasms and soft-hearted wishes
bound together either by religious or by irreligious prejudices.
It is not a heap of statistical matter without logic. Whether
you regard the social science under the form of law, politics,
political economy, or social science in its narrower
application, these negatives all apply. It is only under
some application of scientific methods and scientific tests
that, in this department as in others, any results worth
our notice can be won.</p>

<p>Now the materials, the facts, and the phenomena of
social science are presented to us under two forms: first,
as a successive series, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, in history, in which we see social
forces at work and the social evolution in progress;
secondly, in statistics, in which the contemporaneous phenomena
are presented in groups.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Under this view social
science has promise, at least, of issuing from its present
condition and taking on a steady progress, while it also
becomes evident what history ought to be and how we
ought to use it.</p>

<p>I have thought it necessary to preface the present lecture
with this bare suggestion of the standpoint from which
I take up my subject. For the study of politics, some
questions in political economy, and some social problems,
the history of the United States has greater value than that
of any other country. All the greater is the pity that its
history is as yet unwritten, or all the greater is the humiliation
that the only attempts in that direction which are
worth mentioning have been made by foreign scholars,
and are not even in the English language. In American
history also, for the study of politics and finance, no period
equals in interest the administration of Andrew Jackson.
I propose, therefore, in the limited time I can now command,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
to point out to you the reasons why this period of
our history is worthy of the most attentive study. I may
say here that Professor Von Holst of Freiburg has perceived
the importance and interest of this period and published
a lecture in regard to it which I regard as thoroughly
sound and correct in its standpoint and criticism. His
views coincide with those which I have been accustomed to
present in my lectures on the History of American Politics,
and I have profited, for my present purpose, by some suggestions
of his.</p>

<p>Mr. Monroe was the last of the public men of the first
generation of the republic who succeeded to the presidential
chair by virtue of a certain standing before the public.
During his administration the old parties died out or were
merged in a new party, a compromise between the two.
There followed during his second administration what was
called the “era of good feeling,” during which there were
no party divisions and no strong party feeling. This period
was very instructive, however, for any one who is disposed
to see the evils of party in an exaggerated light, for there
sprang up no less than five aspirants to the succession,
whose interests were pushed by personal arguments solely.
These arguments took the form also, not of enumerating
the services of the candidate favored, but of spreading
scandals about his rivals. The newspapers were loaded
down with weary “correspondence” about “charges and
countercharges” against each of the candidates.</p>

<p>Mr. Crawford of Georgia obtained the nomination of the
democratic congressional caucus in 1824, but loud complaints
were raised against this method of nominating candidates.
It was demanded that the people should be free
from the dominion of King Caucus, and should nominate
and elect freely. No machinery for accomplishing this
was yet at hand, and none was proposed, but the outcry
which was partly justified by the evils of the congressional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
caucus system and partly consisted of phrases which were
sure of great popular effect, greatly injured Mr. Crawford.
He had been Secretary of the Treasury during the financial
troubles of the years following the war, and had managed
that thankless office on the whole very well, but he had not
performed the impossible. He had not brought the finances
of the country into a sound condition while allowing
the banks to do as they chose. He had not kept up the
revenue while trade was prostrated, and he had not crushed
the United States Bank while preserving the business
interest of the country. He had many enemies amongst
those who, on the one side and on the other, thought that
he ought to have done each of these things. Hostility to
the Bank was not as great in 1824 as in 1820, but there
was a large party which was determined in this hostility.
Mr. Crawford was also said to be broken in health, and
this came to be believed so firmly that it has generally
passed into history as one of the chief causes of his defeat.
It is so accepted by Von Holst. Mr. Crawford was disabled
from September, 1823, to September, 1824, but he lived
until 1834, spending the last years of his life as a circuit
judge, and he was well enough in 1830 to ruin John C. Calhoun’s
chances of succeeding General Jackson.</p>

<p>The next candidate was Mr. Adams, Secretary of State
under Mr. Monroe. He enjoyed the support of New England.
There was no question of Mr. Adams’s abilities, or
of his great public services, or of his character; but he was
not popular. I do not, of course, think this at all derogatory
to him, but you observe that it is hard for a man to
despise popularity and at the same time have enough of it
to be elected to office in a democracy. Mr. Adams really
liked popularity and wanted it, and there was a continual
strife within him between the aristocrat who sought independent
and isolated activity to please himself and the
politician who must please others. It is the explanation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
much in his conduct which seemed erratic and inconsistent
to his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Mr. Clay was the candidate of the West, and Mr. Calhoun
of a portion of the South.</p>

<p>These men were all in prominent positions, three of
them in the Cabinet, and one speaker of the House. On
the 20th of August, 1822, the House of Representatives of
Tennessee presented another candidate in the person of
General Jackson. This gentleman had been educated for
a lawyer and had been on the bench of Tennessee. He was
in Congress during the administration of Washington and
voted against a clause in the address of Congress to Washington
on his retirement, in which a hope was expressed
that Washington’s example might be imitated by his successors.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
As a member of Congress he had been noticeable
only for violence of speech and action. At New Orleans
he had won a creditable military success at the close of
a war which had brought little glory on land. While there
he came into collision with the civil court on refusing to
obey a writ of habeas corpus. Some incidents of this event
are especially characteristic of the man. He came into
court March 31, 1815, surrounded by the populace, and
refused to answer interrogatories. Then, pointing to the
crowd, he said to the judge, alluding to the previous judicial
inquiry: “I was then with these brave fellows in
arms; you were not, sir!” He interrupted the judge while
he was reading his decision, saying: “Sir, state facts and
confine yourself to them, since my defence is and has been
precluded; let not censure constitute a part of this sought-for
punishment.” The judge replied: “It is with delicacy,
general, that I speak of your name or character. I consider
you the savior of the country, but for your contempt
of court authority, or to that effect, you will pay a fine of
$1000.” The general drew his check for the sum and retired.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
The crowd dragged his carriage to the French coffee-house,
with acclamations and waving flags. He there
made a speech.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> The fine, amounting with interest to $2,700,
was refunded by Congress in 1844.</p>

<p>In 1818 he had violated the territory of Florida, then
a province of Spain, with whom we were at peace. He
claimed, in 1830, that he had done this with the connivance
of Mr. Monroe. During the same campaign against
the Seminoles he captured two men who were aiding the
enemy and were said to be British subjects. A court-martial
condemned one of them to death and the other
to less punishment. He ordered both executed, thus overruling
the verdict on the side of severity.</p>

<p>The people might have been divided into two great classes
according to the opinion of Jackson which was entertained
in 1822. The more sober and intelligent considered him a
violent, self-willed, ignorant, and untrained man. They
thought that he had perhaps the soldier’s virtues and that
he had done the country good service as a soldier but they
doubted if he had the first qualification of a ruler, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, to
know how to obey. They thought him quarrelsome, vain,
untutored in the forms of civilized life which teach men
to ignore much, to endure more, and to reserve the stake
of personal feeling and personal struggle for the last and
highest emergencies. They perceived, on the contrary,
that he never distinguished great things from small, especially
where his own pride was involved, and that he
had no reserve at all about throwing his personality into
unseemly controversies, which he never shunned but
seemed to like. I have already said that these personal
criminations and recriminations were common at the time;
Mr. Webster is the only prominent public man of the time
who succeeded in avoiding newspaper controversies, and he
did not altogether escape altercations in the Senate. Public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
men were continually scenting attacks on their character and
setting vigorously to work to vindicate the same, not perceiving
that such vindications always derogate from the man
who makes them. This much ought to be said in excuse
for General Jackson if this fault was especially prominent
in him. You may imagine how incredible it seemed to
persons who formed this estimate of Jackson that any one
could soberly propose him for the chair which had hitherto
been filled by Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and
Monroe. The Federalists of New England had had little
affection or admiration for the last three Presidents, but
they had never been ashamed of them as public men.</p>

<p>The other of the two great classes to which I have referred
held a very opposite opinion of General Jackson.
To them he was a military hero and a popular idol. They
liked him better for taking Pensacola in defiance of international
law. They liked him for bearding the judge who
wanted to enforce the habeas corpus. They thought it
spirited in him to hang two Englishmen to solve a doubt.
I do not mean that they reasoned much about it, for they
did not; at bottom they were actuated by an instinct of
fellowship. They recognized a man with the same range
of ideas and feelings, the same contempt for history, law,
Old-World forms, and traditions by which they themselves
were actuated. His bluntness, his rollicking, untamed
manner, his hit-or-miss arguments, his respect for the popular
whim or emotion as the only control he would admit,
his plump ignorance which exceeded omniscience in its
boldness, all flattered the populace and won its favor.
Here was a hero from amongst themselves, using their
methods, despising the restrictions of the cultivated and the
learned, a virtuoso in negligence and carelessness of manner,
aiming at rudeness and bluntness as things worth
cultivating, and elevating want of culture into a qualification
for greatness and a title to honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>In order to understand the full importance of this you
must look at some facts in social and political development
which had immediately preceded. At the adoption of the
Constitution property qualifications limiting the suffrage
were general, but they had been removed steadily and
gradually until by 1820 the suffrage was universal throughout
almost all the states. The Jeffersonian ideas of government
and policy had also spread steadily and rapidly and
had received more and more extended interpretation.
They were fallacious and only half true at best, that is to
say, they were of the most mischievous order of propositions
possible in politics; but in popular use and interpretation
they had become worn into a kind of political cant,
in which the moiety of truth had disappeared and the
residuum of falsehood had become the highest political
truth and the badge of political orthodoxy. To use the
ballot was held synonymous with freedom; the rule of the
numerical majority was made equivalent to the republic;
the “will of the people” was held paramount to the Constitution—which
is nothing more than saying that to do
as you choose is superior to doing as you have agreed. And
it had become a political dogma that, if there are only
enough of you together, when you do as you have a mind
to, you are sure to do right.</p>

<p>I use the past sense here, but you will at once perceive
that I am describing what is still strong amongst us.</p>

<p>Of course there was, outside of these two classes, a large
body of persons, scattered, as to their political opinions,
all the way between the two extremes; but the second
class was large and was growing very rapidly from social
and industrial causes which are yet to be specified.</p>

<p>During the European wars the people of the New England
states made great gains from commerce. In the
middle states manufactures began under the protection of
embargo and war. In the South there was less wealth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
but the possession of land and slaves created an aristocracy
of large political influence over poorer neighbors. In New
York something of the same kind existed, two or three
of the great families struggling with one another for the
political control of the state. These were all democrats
of a peculiar type well worthy of study. They professed
popular principles while they scorned the populace and led
cohorts of uneducated men whom they handled and disposed
of as they chose. After the war the commerce and
industry of the country suffered a heavy reverse from which
it did not recover until 1820 or 1821; but then came the
influence of steam navigation, as the first of the great inventions,
together with the factory system and some great
improvements in machinery, and the position of the artisan,
in spite of the protective policy to which the result
was generally attributed as a cause, underwent a steady
and very great improvement. In 1825 the Erie Canal was
opened and, together with the application of steam to
lake and river navigation, led to an unparalleled development
west of the Alleghanies. In the southwestern states
the immense profits of cotton culture led to rapid settlement
and development. As early as 1816 the tide of immigration
had become marked. It was interrupted during
the hard times but went on again increasing steadily. Thus
you see that the material prosperity of this country was
just taking its great start at the beginning of the twenties.
The natural consequence was that there was a great body
of persons here who had been used to straitened circumstances,
but who now found themselves prosperous, every
year improving their condition. Such a state of things is
of course eminently desirable. Economists and statesmen
are continually trying to bring it about. Observe, however,
some of the inevitable social, political, and moral effects.
This class expanded under the sun of prosperity both its
virtues and its vices. It became self-reliant and independent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
It feared no mishap. It took reckless risks. It
laughed at prudence. It had overcome so many difficulties
that it took no forethought for any yet to come. It
loved dash and bravado and high spirit. It admired energy
and enterprise as amongst the highest human virtues. It
scorned especially theory, or philosophy, and professed
exaggerated faith in the practical man. It never estimated
science very highly until science began to lead to
patent mixtures for various purposes and to mining engineering.
Then it took to business colleges and technical
schools for the dissemination of the same. Especially did
this class despise any historical or scientific doctrines which
came from the other side of the water. It was a general
premise that the new country needed new systems throughout
the whole social and political fabric, and that what was
enforced by European experience was surely inapplicable
here. As against England this assumption was considered
especially strong. In the writings of some of the men who
greatly influenced public opinion from 1820 to 1830 this
amounted almost to fanaticism. “Home industry,” and
“Internal Improvements,” owed much of their success over
the mind of the nation to the industrious use of this prejudice.
These subjects were not political issues until 1830.</p>

<p>Of course I have nothing to do with the question which
to many would seem to be here the only important one,
<abbr>viz.</abbr>, whether these traits are not noble and praiseworthy
and do not constitute the Americans the first nation in
the world. Those are idle questions. Political institutions
are not framed to produce noble and praiseworthy men.
If any are planned to that end they always fail. But political
institutions follow the social and industrial conditions,
if the people adapt themselves to the facts of the case. So
it has been here; and, although I have used the past tense
in this description of the effects of rapid prosperity, you
observe that the features are those which still mark our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
American society as a whole. I have simply to take cognizance
of these effects as facts inseparable from the conditions
of that society.</p>

<p>Here, then, I come to the assertion to which I desire
especially to call your attention under my present subject:
that is, that General Jackson’s personal popularity and his
political influence were not created by him at all, but were
simply the results of the fact that he exactly fitted in as
a leader into the rising class of persons of small property,
low education, and crude notions of politics and finance. Of
this class he was the leader as long as he lived. You will
recognize here an illustration of the wider historical generalization,
that the prominent man and his surroundings
always act and react on one another and the old question
as to which “causes” the other is idle.</p>

<p>Such being the circumstances in 1822, when Jackson’s
name was first mentioned in connection with the Presidency,
the class of persons whom I first described as considering
this a bad joke soon discovered their mistake.
In the following year the people of Blount County, Tennessee
held a meeting at which they passed strong resolutions
in his support,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and it was soon evident to the aspirants at
Washington that he was the most dangerous competitor
of all. Calhoun hastened to retire into the second place,
with the understanding that he was to succeed in four
years, Jackson having pronounced for one term only.
Pending the contest, in 1823, Jackson was elected United
States Senator from Tennessee. The result of the election
of 1824 was that Jackson got 99 votes in the electoral college,
Adams 84, Crawford 41, and Clay 37. Clay was
thus excluded from the contest in the House. His friends
voted for Adams, who got 13 states, Jackson 7, and Crawford
4. The states which voted for Jackson were New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Alabama, and Mississippi. This election was in many
respects important for the history of politics in the country.
I leave aside all but the relation to Jackson and the political
movement which he represented. His friends were
by no means content, and they were not quiet in their
discontent. They accused Clay of carrying his votes over
to Adams by a corrupt bargain, according to which he
was to be Secretary of State in the new Cabinet. There
was less ground for this accusation than for almost any
other personal calumny to be found in our political history,
but it clung to Mr. Clay as long as he lived.</p>

<p>The most significant feature, however, for the political
movement of the time was this: General Jackson’s supporters
claimed that, as he had a plurality of the votes
of the Electoral College, it was shown to be the will of the
people that he should be President, and that the House of
Representatives ought simply to have carried out the popular
will, thus expressed, to fulfillment. You observe the full
significance of the doctrine thus affirmed. The Constitution
provides that the House shall elect a President when
the Electoral College fails to give any candidate a majority.
It confers an independent choice between the three highest
candidates upon the House. Already the independent
choice which the Constitution intended to give to the Electoral
College had been abrogated by Congressional caucus
nominations and pledged elections. It was now claimed
that the House should simply elevate the plurality of the
highest candidate in the College to a majority in the House.
Thus the antagonism between the permanent specification
of the Constitution and the momentary will of the people
was sharply defined. It was the antagonism between the
general law and the momentary impulse, between sober
dispassionate judgment as to what is generally wise and a
special inconvenience or disappointment. I strive to put
it into everyday language because it is a phenomenon of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
human life which is the same whether it is seen in the character
of an individual striving to control his wayward impulses
by general principles, or in the political history of a
great democratic republic seeking to obtain dignity, stability,
and imperial majesty by binding the swaying wishes
of the hour under broad and sacred constitutional provisions.
It was the opening of that issue which is vital to this
republican issue which cleaves down through our entire
political and social fabric, the issue to which parties must
ever return and about which they will always form so long
as this experiment lasts—the issue, namely, of constitutionalism
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">versus</i> democracy, of law <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">versus</i> self-will; the
question whether we are a constitutional republic whose
ultimate bond is the loyalty of the individual citizen to the
Constitution and the laws or a democracy in which at any
time the laws and the Constitution may give way to what
shall seem, although not constitutionally expressed, to be
the will of the people. General Jackson was from the
time of this election the exponent of the latter theory.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that the issue was clearly defined
at the time, or that the parties ranged themselves upon
it with logical consistency. Any student of history knows
that political parties never do that. Still less do I mean to
say that parties since that time have kept strictly to the
position on one side or the other of this issue which their
traditions would require. Political history and political
tradition have little continuity with us, and the fact has
been that the Jacksonian doctrine has permeated our whole
community far too deeply. We have had some who merely
grubbed in a mole-eyed way in the letter of the Constitution,
as indeed Jackson and his fellows did, and we have
had others who were and are restive under any invocation
of the Constitution. True constitutionalism, however, the
grand conception of law, of liberty under law, of the free
obedience of intelligent citizens, is what now needs explaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
and enforcing as the key to any true solution of the
great problems which, as we are told on every side, beset
the republic.</p>

<p>I cannot now follow the history in detail to show the
movements of parties during the next four years. Mr.
Adams’s administration was unfortunate in its attempts to
settle the old misunderstanding with England about the
West India trade. It got that question into one of those
awkward corners, out of which neither party can first seek
exit, which the diplomatist ought to avoid as the worst
form of diplomatic failure. In its home policy it favored
internal improvements and protection to the most exaggerated
degree. But the administration was dignified,
simple, and businesslike. It was a model in these respects
of what an administration under our system ought to be.
It presented no heroics whatever, neither achievements
nor scandals, and approached, therefore, that millenial
form of society in which time passes in peace and prosperity
without anything to show that there is either government
or history.</p>

<p>Nevertheless this administration did not receive justice
from its contemporaries. Mr. Adams seemed always to
feel a certain timidity, which he expressed in his letter to
the House of Representatives on his election, because he
had gone into office without a popular majority. In Congress
he had to deal with an opposition which was factious,
disappointed, and malignant, determined to make the worst
of everything he did and to make capital at every step for
General Jackson. It was a campaign four years long, and
it was conducted by a new class of politicians who made
light of principle and gloried in finesse. The end of the old
system of family leadership in New York and the certainty
that there would never be another congressional caucus,
led to new forms of machinery for manipulating the popular
power. These were set up under loud denunciations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
dynasties, aristocracies, families, dictation, and so on. The
most remarkable and most powerful of these new organs
was the Albany Regency, which shaped our political history
for the next ten or fifteen years. The intrigues of
the period culminated in the tariff act of 1828, in which
Pennsylvania and the South were brought into a strange
coalition to support Jackson and a high tariff, leaving
New England out of the golden shower of tariff-created
wealth, as she held aloof from the support of the popular
idol. I regret that I cannot now stop to analyze and expose
this prime specimen of legislation in which tariff and
politics were scientifically intermingled.</p>

<p>As for political principles, there were none at stake and
none argued in the contest. The struggle was ruthlessly
personal. A month before the election an editorial in
<cite>Niles’s Register</cite> used the following language: “We had
much to do with the two great struggles of parties from
1797 to 1804 and 1808 to 1815, and we are glad that we are
not so engaged in this, more severe and ruthless than either
of the others, and, we must say, derogatory to our country,
and detrimental to its free institutions and the rights of
suffrage, with a more general grossness of assault upon
distinguished individuals than we ever before witnessed.”</p>

<p>Jackson was elected by 178 votes to 83 for Adams. The
criticisms which had been made upon Adams’s administration
were now all used as a basis for representing the entire
government as needing reform. This reform took the form
of removing all persons in office and replacing them by
friends of the new President. Up to this time the tenure
of office in the public service had been during efficiency or
good behavior, although instances of removals for political
reasons had not been wanting and there had been many
changes when Jefferson went into office. I will only say
in passing that the complaints of inefficiency in office and
of corruption during Jackson’s administration steadily and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
justly increased. According to a report by Secretary
Ewing, in 1841, there were lost, to the government between
1829 and 1841, over two millions and a half of dollars by
defalcations of public officials. The Cabinet selected by
Jackson at the outset consisted of obscure men remarkable
only for their loyalty to the person of the President. It may
be said in general of the new appointments to inferior offices
that they constituted a deterioration of the public service.
Two doctrines were now affirmed as democratic principles
which, if they should be accepted as such, would be the condemnation
of democracy to all sober-minded men. The first
was that of rotation in office, which, if it is a democratic
principle, raises inefficiency and venality to permanent features
of the public service. You will observe that its effect
has been, as a matter of history, to make thousands of
people believe despairingly that these things are inseparable
from the public service and that elections only determine
which set shall enjoy the opportunity. The other
doctrine or democratic principle was that to the victors
belong the spoils. This was distinctly enunciated by
William L. Marcy on the floor of the Senate. He said
that he did not hesitate to avow the principle as a principle.
By this principle corruption in the public service
is made a matter of course. I think that these two “principles”
are rotten, and by virtue of their own intrinsic
baseness. If any one is inclined to despair of the republic
now, he ought to remember that there was a time when
men shamelessly professed these doctrines as principles.
I doubt if any one would be bold enough to do it to-day.</p>

<p>Whether General Jackson went into office intending to
make war on the United States Bank, is a question which
has never yet found a solution, but the drift of the
evidence is for the negative. During the summer of 1829
some of the New Hampshire politicians of the new school
endeavored to obtain the removal of Mr. Jeremiah Mason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
from the Presidency of the Portsmouth Branch of the
United States Bank. They brought no charge whatever
against him save that he was a friend of Mr. Webster, and
they urged that some friend of the administration might
make the Branch useful in its service. The Secretary of
the Treasury (Ingham) endeavored to induce the President
of the Bank (Biddle) to remove Mr. Mason. Biddle
refused to do this. In this controversy the administration
men were in the position of striving to bring the Bank into
politics on their side and the Bank was in the position of
striving to remain neutral in politics. From this, however,
dates the great conflict of Jackson’s administration. You
will greatly err in trying to form any judgment in this matter
if you doubt the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bona fides</i> of General Jackson. Where
his personal value was not at stake he was genial, good-natured,
and generous. In questions of policy he was
easily led up to the point at which he formed an opinion.
His opinion might be crystallized, however, suddenly, by
the most whimsical consideratives, or under the most
erratic motives. When he had formed what for him was
an opinion, he clung to it with astonishing obstinacy. It
rose before his mind as a fact of the most undeniable certainty.
The echo of it, which came back to him by virtue
of his popularity, seemed to him to sanction it with the
highest authority. One who denied it was shameless and
unpardonable, one who resisted it deserved any punishment
which the fashions of the age allowed. You recognize
the description of a strong and originally powerful mind
destitute of training.</p>

<p>At the outset the Bank was guilty only of neutrality
where he demanded support. At this time it had lived
down much of the hatred it had justly incurred at the
outset, but there was no difficulty in reviving it. The Bank
was never in a stronger or sounder condition than in 1829,
and it enjoyed high credit both at home and abroad. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
word went out, however, that the Bank was a monopoly,
the possession of the moneyed aristocracy, undemocratic,
and hostile to liberty. The first blow fell, in spite of some
vague premonitory rumors, with great suddenness. In the
annual message of December, 1829, Jackson incorporated
a short paragraph questioning the constitutionality of the
Bank and proposing a Bank on the credit and revenues of
the government. The alarm thus created was twofold,
first on account of the Bank which was threatened, and
second on account of the new institution which sounded
like a government paper money bank. Parties did not as
yet divide on this issue. The strongest partisans of Jackson
took up the cry against the Bank, but not yet with
vigor; the more intelligent supporters of the administration
still favored it. In 1830 the message was much milder
in regard to the Bank, and the Treasury Report was
even favorable to it. In 1831, however, the message was
once more strongly hostile.</p>

<p>In the meantime the President had vetoed an internal
improvement bill and taken up a position of hostility to
the policy of improvements. The tariff of 1828 had provoked
the South to more and more energetic protests until
South Carolina adopted the doctrine and policy of nullification.
There never was a greater political error, for she
alienated the vast body of the nation, even in the South,
which might have been brought to oppose protection but
would not favor nullification as a means of destroying it.
It was in this connection that Jackson’s traits availed to
procure him, in his own day, the approval of men like Webster
and has availed to give him a place amongst our political
heroes and in the hearts of people who to-day know
little more about him than that he prevented nullification.
He certainly acted with very commendable firmness in
giving it to be understood that nullification meant rebellion
and war. His attitude and, far more, the legislation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
session of 1832–1833 including the compromise tariff of
March 2, 1833, averted civil war. What part in all this
drama was played by his hostility to Mr. Calhoun it is
difficult to say. They were now sworn enemies, General
Jackson having been informed (by Mr. Crawford) that Mr.
Calhoun, instead of being his friend in the cabinet of Mr.
Monroe, had been one of those who disapproved of his
acts in the Seminole war in 1878. General Jackson upon
this diverted the succession from Mr. Calhoun and, after
taking a second term himself, gave the succession to
Martin Van Buren, a weak and unpopular candidate, who
had, by virtue of his position in the Albany Regency,
given New York to Jackson. Mr. Van Buren was Secretary
of State in Jackson’s first cabinet, which suddenly exploded
in 1831 on a question of social etiquette. He was
next nominated to the English mission and went out, but
failed of confirmation, an incident only worth mentioning
because the hotter partisans of Jackson proposed to abolish
the Senate for rejecting one of his nominations.</p>

<p>All these and other personalities which it is impossible
to group in any way, and which I cannot follow into detail,
played their part in the great drama which was opening.
The popular democratic party was gaining ground
every day. A consciousness of power, a desire to assume
public duties from which they had hitherto held aloof, was
taking stronger possession of them. On the other hand, an
opposition was forming under the name of the National Republican
party which had a certain vague legitimacy of
descent from the old Federal party. It adopted as its principles
protection, internal improvements, distribution of the
public lands, and the National Bank. This party first began
to be called Whigs in Connecticut, in 1834.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> It always
seemed strangely lacking in political sagacity. It offered to
its enemies the very strongest arguments against itself. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
had managed to get on the side, which will pass into history
as the wrong side, of at least three great questions and
perhaps also of the fourth. It forced the administration
into an impregnable position in regard to free trade, hard
money, and an opposition to the distribution of land or
revenue; and it managed in the end to put itself unequivocally
in the wrong and the opposite party in the right on
the sub-treasury and the public finances.</p>

<p>It commenced its career as a party by a great blunder—an
act which was recognized as such immediately afterwards—and
that was the effort to re-charter the Bank in
1832. It had been the strongest answer of the Bank to
Jackson’s early attacks that its charter did not expire until
March 3, 1836, that he had forced the issue of a re-charter
on the country six and a half years before the time, and
that he had nothing to do with the re-charter unless he
assumed that he was to be reëlected. The National Republican
convention was held at Baltimore on December 12,
1831. Mr. Clay was nominated for President. The petition
for a re-charter was presented January 9, 1832, as a
manœuvre in the campaign. Forthwith the charge of anticipating
an exciting question was turned against the opposition.
They were charged with bringing the Bank into
politics, and the Bank was forced into the political campaign
to defend its existence. The re-charter was passed
July 4, 1832, and vetoed July 10. Up to this time there
had been plenty of administration men who favored the
Bank. This issue, thus forced by the opposition on the
eve of election, and thus accepted by the President for
his own person, raised Bank on Anti-Bank to a test of
political orthodoxy, and, in the political language of the
time, many were forced to “turn a sharp corner.” The
issue was now also Jackson <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">versus</i> the Bank, and then first
did it become apparent to what extent the Jackson party
had gained and how thorough was its devotion. The current<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
party names were Jackson and Anti-Jackson, and candidates
were so designated down to the lowest town officers.
The Whigs protested in vain against the folly of this. They
argued with men who would not argue, and assumed the
force of motives the powerlessness of which was proved
by the fact that men could profess such personal political
allegiance. They did not truly appreciate the democracy
in which they lived. They suffered themselves to be isolated
as a body and they lost the proper conservative power
of an opposition by failing to go with the sentiment of the
vast energetic, growing (if you choose to call it so), vulgar
democracy. It is a danger which always besets the conservative
party here, whose members will always be a minority,
and will always find much to offend their refinement in
a new community like this. They will always be tempted
to withdraw from contact with it and to gratify their
vanity at the expense of all public influence.</p>

<p>The consequence of the issue as it was made in 1832 was
that Jackson got 219 and Clay 49 votes in the Electoral
College.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> Things now entered on a new stage. The lower
class which I have hitherto endeavored to characterize
fairly, but without timidity, now took on the character of
a genuine proletariat. It has been only at few periods that
any development of the lowest sections of our population
has produced what could properly be called by that name.
The period of Jackson’s second administration was the
most marked of these. In the large cities trades-unions
arose, and in certain sections agrarian doctrines were advocated,
while there was a general dissemination of socialistic
notions. In 1836 there were formal riots and public
disturbances of lesser grade. Partly this was due to the
arrogance of class success, partly to the flattery of demagogues,
and partly to industrial changes and to currency
disturbances which are to be mentioned in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>The National Bank being doomed if Jackson should be
reëlected, a large moneyed class had been drawn into the
administration party, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, those who wanted to found
local banks. The administration party, therefore, included
these two branches, to the former or lower of which the
nickname Locofoco was given.</p>

<p>General Jackson regarded his reëlection as a sanction of
all that he had done or proposed. According to his principles
the question of wisdom in banking and currency did
not come from history or science, but from a majority vote
of the people. What is to be noticed, however, is that the
people simply assented to whatever he proposed and ratified
whatever he did, because it was he that did it. There
resulted a state of things paralleled in our history only in
the case of Mr. Jefferson, that is, an action and reaction
between the executive and a popular majority in which
each stimulated the other by ready sympathy and mutual
support. The President pursued his way without a misgiving,
and the opposition in Congress while they saw their
members dwindling and the majority becoming more and
more overwhelming, could only express their astonishment
at the sudden acts and irregular methods of procedure of
the executive. The subservient majority, consisting largely
of professional politicians of the new type, recognized that
for the time being their occupation of plotting and controling
was gone. Their hopes lay in no independent action,
but in loyalty to the chief.</p>

<p>I feel here how much I am saying which under other
circumstances would require proof, but the proof lies before
any one who will throw aside Benton and Parton and look
into the Congressional debates and the newspapers of the
time.</p>

<p>The President now pushed on his hostility to the Bank,
being doubly enraged by the efforts it had made to fight its
own battle in contending against him during the campaign.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
He avowed his determination to make the “experiment”
of using local banks as fiscal agents of the government.
Naturally enough, the banking and commercial world was
frightened at experiments, carried on without skill or knowledge
and running athwart the financial and business interests
of the country. Up to this time, you must remember,
the administration had not pronounced for specie currency
at all, but it was supposed that the President favored
a government paper bank. In his Bank veto message he
had said that a charter for a Bank which would have been
free from objection might have been obtained by coming
to him beforehand. In his first message after his reëlection
he raised the question whether the public deposits were
safe in the Bank and whether the government shares in the
Bank ought not to be sold. In spite of all that had gone
before these were startling questions. A majority of the
Committee of Ways and Means found the deposits safe.
The minority made some strong and undeniable points
against the Bank.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1833 Amos Kendall was appointed
agent to see what banks could be engaged to take the public
deposits. On August 19 of that year the five government
directors of the Bank made a report showing the amount
expended by the Bank in printing during the campaign,
and on September 18, 1833, the President read to his
cabinet a paper setting forth the reasons why the public
deposits should be removed from the United States Bank.
The Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Duane, refused to give
the order for removal and was dismissed. Mr. Taney was
made Secretary and he ordered that no further sums should
be deposited in the Bank by collectors or others. December
3, 1833, he reported to Congress his reasons for doing
this. On December 9, the government directors sent in a
memorial to Congress saying that they had been shut out
from a knowledge of the affairs of the Bank. On March 28,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
1834, the Senate, after having tried in vain to pass a more
specific censure, resolved that the President had “assumed
upon himself authority and power not conferred by the
Constitution and the laws.” On April 15, the President
sent in a protest against this resolution, saying that if he
had been guilty of violating the Constitution he ought to be
impeached, not censured by resolution. This protest the
Senate refused to register. They could not impeach him,
and the House was far from thinking of such a thing. In
fact, the question of status of the Secretary of the Treasury
is a delicate one. Some independent responsibility is laid
upon him, according to the laws of 1789 and 1800, but, as
he is liable to be dismissed by the President, he cannot have
an independent responsibility. The resolution of censure
was “expunged” on January 16, 1837. In the House of
Representatives, on April 4, 1834, it was resolved that the
Bank ought not to be re-chartered, that the deposits ought
not to be restored, that the state banks ought to be made
depositories of the public funds, and that a select committee
on the Bank should be raised. The majority of this committee
reported, on May 22, that the Bank had refused to
submit to investigation, while the minority (Everett and
Ellsworth) reported that the majority had made unreasonable
demands. On February 4, 1834 the Senate had referred
to the Finance Committee an inquiry in regard to the Bank;
and at the next session, on December 18, 1834, the Committee
reported, by John Tyler, favorably to the Bank in
every respect. In the message of December, 1834, the
President reviewed the whole war against the Bank and
summed up the charges against it. Therewith the political
and congressional war over the old Bank came to an end
with a full victory for the administration.</p>

<p>The earliest announcement of the policy of the administration
in favor of a metallic currency was in a reply made
by the President<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> in February, 1834, to a deputation from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
Philadelphia who came to complain of the hard times.
According to the report they gave, the President was very
rude and violent. He ascribed all the trouble to the “monster,”
as he called the Bank over and over again. He declared
that he would introduce a specie currency and that
the government should use no other. He evidently knew
little of the laws of money and finance, and, although much
which he and his supporters afterwards urged in support
of this policy was as true and sound as any propositions in
physical science, yet it was mixed up with fallacies which
neutralized it, and it degenerated into a kind of fanaticism
about the precious metals. The measure of distributing
the deposits amongst local banks, and thereby stimulating
bank credits, was destructive to the other measure of introducing
a specie currency. The distribution of the surplus
revenue, which had accumulated in the banks amongst
the states, was an opposition measure that was passed on
account of the foolish belief, which so often leads our politicians
astray, that there was political capital in it. Jackson
signed the bill, but he criticized it in his next message,
giving plain and statesmanlike reasons against it.</p>

<p>I must mention one other institution which took its
rise in this period, and that is the national convention.
I have already mentioned the Convention of the National
Republicans at Baltimore in 1831. The Jackson men held
one at Baltimore on May 21, 1832. With this invention our
political institutions entered on a new phase, and “politician”
acquired a new meaning. The power of party,
the binding force of caucus agreements, the conception of
bolting a regular nomination as the highest political crime,
were developed first in the ranks of the Jackson party,
but speedily followed to the best of their ability by the
opposition. The Tammany Club of New York was the
school in which these political arts were cultivated to
the highest pitch, to be imitated elsewhere. There had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
been loud shouts over the downfall of “King Caucus” when,
in 1824, the candidate of the congressional caucus was
defeated, but the fact was that King Caucus had only just
come of age and was entering into his inheritance. Behind
the convention speedily arose the class of politicians vulgarly
known as wire-pullers who spent their time between
elections in intriguing and plotting and distributing. The
Albany Regency found that its power slipped away into the
hands of these more secret operators. There sprang up
men who did not care for office, who lived no one knew how,
or who took offices which to them were sinecures while
they wielded the real political power. The convention
proved to be an engine well adapted to the purposes of
this class. It had all the forms of freedom, publicity,
and popular initiative, while the real manipulation was
astonishingly easy for two or three shrewd and experienced
men. I am using the past tense here again for decency’s
sake. I wish that I could do so because the things I
describe were really matters of history.</p>

<p>You see now that I have spared nothing whatever here,
neither national pride, nor party prejudice, nor hereditary
family feeling. My business is simply with the truth of
history so far as it is attainable, and so far as I am able
faithfully to state it. It would be very easy now to say
that Andrew Jackson demoralized American politics, and to
throw upon his memory the blame for all the political
troubles, shames, and problems of which we are every day
reminded. Such, however, would be very far from the
inference I want to draw. I have tried to emphasize the
fact that Jackson himself was only a typical and representative
man in and of his time, that it is often difficult
to say whether he led or was carried forward. His administration,
in the view I have tried to present, was only
the time at which a certain tendency came to victory.
It was only a case of the conflict which constitutes great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
political parties under all governments, the conflict between
the radical and conservative tendencies. The radical
tendency had won one victory under Jefferson, and, coming
into office, had become conservative. In Jackson’s elevation
a new radical tendency, more excessive than the
first, came to victory. I have shown also in my criticism
on the Whig party how it fell out of sympathy with the
great movement which was going on and which was inevitably
conditioned in the social and economic circumstances
of the country.</p>

<p>This tendency has still pursued its way down to our own
times. The party which organized under Jackson became
involved in the slavery question by combinations
which it would be most interesting to study; but this
will be only a passing phase, a temporary issue in our
political life, and only a feature of the history of the concrete
Democratic party, not of the great democratic tendency.
The doctrines of the Jacksonian democracy have
permeated nearly the whole country. They have come
to be popularly regarded as postulates or axioms of civil
liberty. Those who deny them are the scholars, the historians,
the philosophers, the book-men of every grade;
and they deny them under their breath, at the penalty of
sacrificing all share in public life. It is certain, however,
that the issue must come back to its permanent form
and that the political strife must be waged between the
conservative and the radical theories of politics—between
those who lay the greater stress on law and those who
lay the greater stress on liberty, between those who see
political health chiefly in the social principle and those who
see it chiefly in the individual, between constitutionalism
and democracy.</p>

<p>This will not come about by any critical reflections of
mine or by those of any other political philosopher. It
will come about by experience, and by instinct rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
than by reflection. For the evils and corruptions of which
we daily complain arise from democratic theories of politics,
developed and applied without reference to the actual
circumstances of the case, and under assumptions which
are false. Experience has convinced nearly all of us who
are willing to think about the matter that rotation in office
is mischievous to the public interest and demoralizing to
the men who enter the public service. Experience has
long since brought home to us the shame of the doctrine
that to the victors belong the spoils. Experience has
shown us the evils of frequent elections and short terms of
office, and it is continually opening the eyes of more and
more of us to the evils of electing a large number of administrative
officers and making them independent of each
other. Experience has shown us the inapplicability of the
principle of election to the selection of judges. Experience
is showing that the notion of the responsibility of a party
is a delusion and that the notion of responsibility to the
people is only a jingle of words; and as new constitutions
are formed we find that they continually take more guarantees
from the people against themselves.</p>

<p>On the contrary the path of reform lies in the direction
of stronger constitutional guarantees and greater reverence
for law as law. Any conservative party which fulfills its
function in this country will have to take its stand on that
platform. Its reforms must be historical, not speculative.
They must be founded in the genius and history of the
country. The democracy here, in the sense of the widest
popular participation in public affairs, is inevitable until
the land is taken up and the population begins to press
upon the means of subsistence, that is to say, for a future
far beyond what we need take into consideration. Our
whole history shows this, and the part which I have discussed
shows conclusively what we may also all see in our
own daily observation—that the men, the parties, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
theories which oppose themselves to this tendency are
swept down like seeds before a flood. It is idle to ask
whether is it a good tendency. It is a fact—a fact
whose causes arise from the deepest and broadest social
and economic circumstances of the country. But there
is a foundation for true constitutionalism in the traditions
of our race and in our inherited institutions—in our inherited
reverence for law, which is all that keeps us from
going the way of Mexico and Peru.</p>

<p>The philosophers and book-men have no great rôle offered
them in a new country. They will always be a minority,
they will always be holding back in the interest of law,
order, tradition, history, and they will rarely be entrusted
with the conduct of affairs; but, since their lot is cast here,
if they withdraw from the functions which fall to them in
this society, such as it is, they do it at the sacrifice not only
of duty but also of everything which makes a fatherland
worth having, to them or to their posterity. The fault
which they commit is the complement of that committed
by their opponents. For the notion which underlies democracy
is that of rights, tenacity in regard to rights, the
brutal struggle for room for one’s self, and, still more
specifically, for <em>equal</em> rights, the root principle of which is
envy. This was abundantly illustrated in Jackson’s day.
The opposition of his supporters to bank and tariff had no
deeper root than this, and the name they chose for themselves
as descriptive of their aims was “The Equal
Rights Party.” But the principle of political life lies not
in rights but in duties. The struggle for rights is at best
war. The subjection to duty reaches the same end, reaches
it far better, and reaches it through peace. Still less is
there any principle of political health in the idea of <em>equality</em>
of rights, much as some people seem to believe the opposite.
In political history it has been the melancholy
province of France to show us that if you emphasize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
equality you reduce all to a dead level of slavery, with a
succession of revolutions to bring about a change of
masters.</p>

<p>If, then, the classes which are by education and position
conservative withdraw from public activity, pride themselves
on their cleanness from political mire, and satisfy
themselves at most with a negative and destructive interference
at the polls from time to time, the conception of
political duty with them must be as low as with their
opponents; and I will add that they will at best turn from
one set of masters to another, under a general and steady
deterioration in the political tone of the country. If we
have to-day a society in which we go our ways in peace,
freedom, and security, a society from the height of which
we look back upon the life of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries with a shudder, we owe it to no class of
men who wrote satirical essays on contemporary politics
and said to one another: “What is the use?” Elliott
and Hampden and Sydney and these revolutionary heroes
whose praise we are just now chanting did not win for us
all the political good we owe them by any such policy as
that. There was no use, as far as any one could see, in their
cases. They risked persecution, imprisonment, the axe,
and the scaffold, and their puny efforts seemed ridiculous
in the face of the task they undertook; but they never
stopped to think of that. They saw that it was the right
thing to do then to speak or to resist, and they did it and
let the end take care of itself.</p>

<p>Now we Americans of to-day have no heroic deeds to
perform. We have no fear of the stake or the axe for
political causes. We are not called upon to do any grand
deeds. Perhaps it would be easier if we were. If we had
a Cæsar at Washington I would warrant him his Brutus
within a fortnight. But we have need of the same sense
of duty which has animated all the heroes of constitutional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
government and civil liberty, and I am not sure but we
need some of their courage also, for it demands at least
as much moral courage to beard King Majority as it ever
did to beard King Cæsar. Nothing less than the experiment
of self-government is at stake in the question whether
thousands of citizens are capable of that form of duty
which makes a man work on without results and without
reward, even, it may be, in the face of misrepresentation
and abuse, simply because he sees a certain direction in
which his efforts ought to be expended.</p>

<p>Such, however, I conceive to be the calling of the conservative
classes of this country, at least for this generation.
We have undertaken to govern ourselves, and we are just
finding, now that the country is filling up and its cities
growing large, that it is a great task, that it takes time and
thought, that we need any and all resources of science and
experience which we can call to our aid; and we are finding
especially that the forms of law and of the Constitution
are every year more essential, and the untamed forces
of society more dangerous. No supernatural interference
will come to our assistance. No man, no committee, no
party, no centralized organization of the general government,
can rid us of our difficulties and yet leave us self-government.
Nor can we invent any machinery of elections
or of government which will do the work for us. We have
got to face the problems like men, animated by patriotism,
acting with business-like energy, standing together for
the common weal. Whenever we do that we cannot fail
of success in getting what we want; so long as we do
not do that, our complaints of political corruption are the
idlest and most contemptible expressions which grown men
can utter.</p>

<span class="subhead">[1877–1878]</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> decade from 1830 to 1840 is the most important
and interesting in the history of the United States.
The political, social, and industrial forces which were in
action were grand, and their interaction produced such
complicated results, that it is difficult to obtain a just
and comprehensive view of their relations and influences.
In the first place, the United States advanced between the
second war with England and 1830 to a position of full
and high standing in the family of nations. The security
and stability of the government were accepted as established.
England and France, on the other hand, just
before and after 1830, were involved in social and political
troubles of an alarming kind. By contrast, the United
States, with a rapidly increasing population, expanding
production and trade, a contented people, and a surplus
revenue offered great attractions to both laborers and
capital. At the same time the pride of the Americans in
their country produced self-reliance, energy, and enterprise
which laughed at difficulties. New means of transportation
by steamboats and canals were opening up the
country and assuring to the population the advantages of
a new and unbounded continent. Production therefore
offered high returns to both labor and capital.</p>

<p>The advantages of a new country were credited to the
political institutions of democracy, and increasing prosperity,
due to the fresh resources brought within reach,
was held to be proof of the truth of the political dogmas
entertained by the workers. A sort of boyish exuberance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
compounded of inexperience, ignorance, and fearless enterprise,
marked politics as well as industry. Jackson’s
election in 1828 brought to power a party which had been
produced by these circumstances.</p>

<p>The war debt of 1812 became payable in the years after
1824 and was distributed over the period down to 1835.
With growth and increasing prosperity, the revenue increased
with such rapidity that the debt could be paid
almost as fast as it became payable. The chief purposes
for which the Bank of the United States had been founded
in 1816 were to provide a sound and uniform paper currency
convertible with specie, of uniform value throughout
the Union, and to act as fiscal agent for the government,
holding the revenue wherever collected and disbursing the
expenditures wherever they were to be made. The interest
of the government and the people was the motive, and the
bank charter was a contract with the Bank to perform the
services for specified considerations. One of the considerations
was the right of the Bank to use the deposits as
loanable capital. The government was not bound to keep
any balance over expenditure, but the revenue was so large
that the Bank came to hold annually increasing average deposits
of from five to eight or nine millions of public money,
which it used for profit. From this vicious arrangement
two consequences followed: first, public attention was
directed to the deposits, not as existing for the public
service, but for the profit of the Bank; and, second, the
public considered itself entitled to claim something of the
Bank besides true business credit, in the matter of discounts.</p>

<p>Jackson opened the war on the Bank publicly in his
first message. Sharp correspondence had been going
on already between the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Bank, which had reached such a point that the Secretary
had referred to the removal of the deposits as a power in
his hands to coerce the Bank. Generally speaking, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
state of the Bank and the state of the currency were satisfactory
in 1830, but the Bank had begun in 1827 to issue
branch drafts which stimulated credit and soon produced
mischief. Of the war on the Bank it is not necessary to
speak in detail. In December, 1831, Clay was nominated
for President by the National Republicans, and he and
his friends determined to bring on the question of the re-charter
of the Bank as a campaign issue. The re-charter
was passed by Congress and vetoed by the President
in 1832. The issue in the campaign was thus made up between
the personal popularity of Jackson and of the Bank.
The former won an overwhelming victory which he construed
to mean that the people had weighed the question
of re-chartering the Bank and had decided against it.</p>

<p>In September, 1833, he removed the deposits from the
National Bank on his own responsibility, and placed them
in selected state banks which would agree to keep one-third
of their note circulation in coin, redeem all notes
on demand, and issue no notes under a five-dollar denomination.
This was to be an experiment. In the meantime the
administration was eagerly pressing on the extinction of
the public debt. The consequences were such as to prove
that, however popular such a policy may be, it may easily be
carried too far. The public deposits were loaned by the
Bank to merchants, then recalled and paid to the public
creditors, and then reinvested by them, so that the money
market was subjected to recurrent and sudden shocks. The
withdrawal and transfer of the deposits constituted another
and more violent operation of the same kind, so that there
was a crisis and panic in the spring of 1834. The eight or
nine millions of public deposits were a continual source of
mischief to the money market. By the contraction of the
Bank of the United States to pay the deposits, and the
contraction of the state banks to put themselves within
the rule for receiving the same, the currency, in the summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
of 1834, was perhaps better than ever before. The coinage
act of June, 1834, turned the standard over from silver to
gold.</p>

<p>The deposit banks were urged to discount freely so as
to satisfy the public with the change. Banks were organized
in great numbers all over the country to take the place
of the great Bank and to get a share in the profits of handling
the public money. On January 1, 1835, the debt was all
paid and the government had no further use for its surplus
revenue. There was but one correct and straightforward
course to pursue in such a case and that was to lower taxes
so as not to collect any surplus, but this the Compromise
Act forbade. The surplus revenue was the greatest annoyance
to the protectionists who wanted to keep duties high
for “incidental protection,” and they proposed scheme
after scheme for distributing the lands, or the proceeds
of the lands, or, finally, the surplus revenue itself, so as
to cut down the revenue without reducing the import
duties.</p>

<p>With the increase of banks and bank issues speculation
began. It became marked in the spring of 1835 and went
on increasing for two years. Cotton was rising in price,
for the new machinery, and new means of transportation
in England, together with the extension of joint stock
banks there, had given a great stimulus to the cotton
manufacturer. There was an increasing demand for the
raw material. It followed that the cities in which the
exchange and banking of all this industry were carried
on also enjoyed great prosperity. Railroads were just
being introduced and ships were needed to transport the
products. Thus from natural causes the period was one of
immense industrial development. The great need for
carrying it on was capital, and the political incidents which
brought about or encouraged the bank expansion may be
regarded as accidental. The combination of the two in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
fact, however, produced a wild speculation. The banks
furnished credit, not capital, and being restrained by usury
laws from exerting through the rate of discount the proper
check upon an inflated or speculative market they embarked
with the business community on a course where all
landmarks were soon lost.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, was this condition of the commercial
and banking community well established than a
new shock was given by another political interference.
The administration had now advanced to the point of
desiring to establish a specie currency for the country.
The object was laudable and the means taken were proper,
but, following as they did in the train of the events already
mentioned, they produced new confusion. In 1836 various
acts were passed to bring about a specie currency, and in
July of that year the Secretary of the Treasury ordered
the receivers of public money to take only gold and silver
for lands. The circumstances warranted this order. The
sales of lands had risen from two or three to twenty-four
million dollars in a year, and the amount was paid in the
notes of “banks”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> which deserved no credit. If the nation
was not to be swindled out of the lands the measure was
necessary. It then became necessary for the purchasers
of land to carry specie to the West and vast amounts of it
accumulated in the offices of the receivers, or were transferred
at great trouble and expense to deposit banks. The
specie was obtained from the eastern banks, and inasmuch
as the whole existing system had pushed them to the utmost
limit of expansion, these demands for specie were embarrassing.
Two points here deserve notice. It is strange
to see what a superstition about “specie” had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
possession of the public mind. It was regarded as a good
thing to have, but too good to use. A specie dollar was
regarded as an excuse for its owner to print and circulate
from three to twenty paper ones, but it was not regarded
as having any other use. The withdrawal of the specie
basis from an inflated paper was no doubt a serious blow
to the whole fabric, but, if the paper had not been redundant
the transfer of specie to the West could only have
forced an importation of so much more. This superstition
about specie also prevented any demand upon the banks
for specie for any purpose. Such a demand was regarded
as a kind of social or business crime. Hence the “convertibility”
of the notes was a polite fiction. The second
point worth noticing is that the bank advocates continually
talked about “the credit system” when they meant the
system of issuing credit bank notes; and they grew eloquent
about the advantages of credit, as if those advantages
could only be won by using worthless bank notes and not
by lending gold or silver or capital in any form.</p>

<p>We are not yet, however, at the end of the political acts
which threw the money market into convulsions. The
opposition succeeded, in the summer of the presidential
election year, 1836, in passing an act to <em>deposit</em> with the
states the surplus over a balance of five millions in the
Treasury on January 1, 1837. The amount was thirty-seven
millions. This sum was scattered in eighty-nine deposit
banks all over the country. Its distribution was, therefore,
controlled by local pressure and political favoritism, not
by the needs of the government (for it did not need the
money at all) or by the demand and supply of capital.
The banks had regarded it as a permanent deposit and had
loaned it in aid of the various public and private enterprises
which were being pushed on every hand at such a rate that
labor was said to be drawn away from agriculture so that the
country was importing bread stuffs. It was now to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
withdrawn and transferred once more, and this time it was
said that, if these “deposits” were such an advantage, the
states ought to have it, and could then, as well as the banks,
be called on to give back the money whenever it might be
needed. The deposit took place in 1837, in three installments,
January, April, and July, and amounted to twenty-eight
millions. The fourth installment was never paid.
The money was all squandered or worse.</p>

<p>The charter of the Bank of the United States was to
expire on the 3d of March, 1836. One year before that
time the directors ordered the “exchange committee” to
loan the capital, as fast as it should be released, on stocks,
so as to prepare for winding up. From this resolution
dates the subsequent history of the Bank, for the exchange
committee consisted of the President and two directors
selected by him, to whose hands the whole business of the
Bank was hereby entrusted. The branches were sold and
the capital gradually released throughout 1835, but in
February, 1836, an act was suddenly passed by the Pennsylvania
legislature to charter the United States Bank of
Pennsylvania, continuing the old Bank. The act was
said to have been obtained by bribery, but investigation
failed to prove it. The most open bribery was on the
face of it, for it provided for several pet local schemes of
public improvement, for a bonus and loans to the state by
the Bank, and for abolishing taxes—provisions which
secured the necessary support to carry it.</p>

<p>During the year 1836 the money market was very stringent.
The enterprises, speculations, and internal improvements
demanded continual new supplies of capital. The
amount of securities exported grew greater and greater
and kept the foreign exchanges depressed. American
importing houses contracted larger and longer debts to
foreign agents. The money market in England became
very stringent likewise, and these long credits became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
harder and harder to carry. Three English houses, Willson,
Wildes, and Wiggins, had become especially engaged
in these American credits which they found it necessary
to curtail. The winter was one of continual stringency,
aggravated by popular discontent, riots, and trades-union
disturbances, arising from high prices and high rents. The
failures commenced on the fourth of March, 1837, the day
that Van Buren was inaugurated, in Mississippi and Louisiana.
Hermann, Briggs &amp; Co., of New Orleans, failed, with
liabilities said to be from four to eight millions. As soon
as this was known in New York, their correspondents,
J. L. &amp; S. Joseph &amp; Co. failed. The first break in the expanded
fabric of credit therefore came in connection with
cotton. The price had advanced so much during the last
three or four years as to draw many thousands of persons
who had no capital into cotton production, but the profits
were so great that a good crop or two would pay for all the
capital. The planters of Mississippi especially had accordingly
organized themselves into banking corporations
and issued notes as the easiest way to borrow the capital
they wanted. From 1830 to 1839 the banking capital of
Mississippi increased from three to seventy-five millions,
which of course represented one credit built upon another,
on renewed and extended debt, as the old planters bought
more slaves and took up more land instead of paying for
the old, or as new settlers came in. Mississippi was therefore
indebted to the Northeast for the redemption of their
immense bank debt, or for the capital bought with it.
The high rates for money in England and this country
at last checked the rise in cotton in 1836. Bad harvests
and high prices for food fell in with a glut of manufactured
cotton, and when cotton began to fall ruin was certain.
As soon as the revulsion came it ran through the whole
speculative system. The new suburbs which had been laid
out in every city and village never came to anything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
Western lands lost all speculative value, and railroad and
canal stock fell with rapidity.</p>

<p>The first resort for help was to Mr. Biddle. The calamity
most apprehended was a shipment of specie, and the effort
was to gain an extension of credit or the substitution of
a better for a less known credit. The Bank of the United
States had high credit in Europe, and indeed all over the
world. Ultimately payment must be made by crops yet
to be produced or forwarded. Biddle entered into an
agreement with the New York banks which seems to have
been only partially carried out, but he sold post notes
payable one year from date at Barny’s in London. He
received one hundred and twelve and one-half for these,
specie being at one hundred and seven. The bonds were
discounted in England at five per cent. United States
Bank stock was at one hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>The situation in England was so serious that all seemed
to depend on remittances from the United States. The
Bank of England extended aid to “the three W’s” to the
extent of five hundred thousand pounds on a guarantee
made up in the city, and opened a credit of two million
pounds for the United States Bank, if one-half the amount
should be shipped in specie. To this condition the United
States Bank would not agree. The proposition attributed
to the Bank of the United States a strength which it did
not possess. The management of the Bank of England in
this and the two following years was bad, and did much to
enhance the mischief in both countries. France participated
in the distress although there had been no speculation
there.</p>

<p>A delegation of New York merchants was sent to Washington
on May 3 to ask the President to recall the specie circular,
to defer the collection of duty bonds, and to call an
extra session of Congress. In their address to him they
sum up the situation: in six months at New York, real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
estate had shrunk forty millions; in two months two
hundred and fifty firms had failed, and stocks had shrunk
twenty millions; merchandise had fallen thirty per cent,
and within a few weeks twenty thousand persons had been
thrown out of employment.</p>

<p>Early in May three banks at Buffalo failed. On May 8,
the Dry Dock Bank (New York) failed. On the tenth
all the New York City banks suspended. The militia were
under arms and there were fears of a riot. On the eleventh
the Philadelphia banks suspended, because the New York
banks had, and because, although they had plenty of specie
for themselves, they had not enough for the whole “Atlantic
seaboard.” They said, however, that they were debtors,
on balance, to New York. As the news spread through
the country, the banks, with few exceptions, suspended.
It was one of the notions born of the bank war that the
United States Bank was guilty of oppression when it called
on state banks for their balances, and the state banks
had practiced “leniency” towards each other. Bank
statements of the period show enormous sums as due to and
from other banks. This was what carried them all down
together, for one could not stand alone unless its debits
and credits were with the same banks.</p>

<p>During the summer the governors of several states
called extra sessions of the legislatures. The President
had refused to recall the specie circular, or to call an extra
session of Congress, but the embarrassments of the Treasury
forced him to do the latter. The collection of duty
bonds was deferred and the revenue thereby cut off. The
public money was in the suspended banks, and the Treasury,
nominally possessed of forty millions, at the very
time when part of this sum was being paid to the states,
had to drag along from day to day by the use of drafts on
its collectors for the small sums received or by chance left
over in their hands since the suspension. As notes under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
five dollars had been forbidden by nearly all the states,
and as specie was at ten per cent premium, all small change
disappeared, and the towns were flooded with notes and
tickets for small sums, issued by municipalities, corporations,
and individuals.</p>

<p>The most interesting fact connected with this commercial
credit is that New York and Philadelphia took opposite
policies in regard to it, and thus offered, in their differing
experience, an experimental test of those policies. The New
York legislature passed an act allowing suspension for one
year. The New York policy then was to contract liabilities
and prepare for resumption at the date fixed. The
Philadelphia policy, in which Mr. Biddle was the leader,
was to wait without active exertions for things to get better.
In his letter of May 13 to Adams, Biddle said that the
Bank could have gone on without trouble, but that consideration
for the rest forced him to go with them. What
especially moved him was that, if the Pennsylvania banks
had not suspended, Pennsylvanians would have had to do
business with a better currency than the New Yorkers,
which would have been unfair. Mr. Biddle knew perfectly
well that the exchanges would arrange all that.
He was an adept at writing plausible letters. The truth,
which was not known until four years later, was that the
capital of the Bank had never been withdrawn from the
stock loans, that the chief officers of the Bank were plundering
it, and that suspension was not more welcome to any
institution in the country than to the great Bank. The
jealousy between New York and Philadelphia was very
great at this time. Mr. Biddle’s personal vanity seems
to have been greatly flattered when, in March, he was called
on by the New Yorkers to help them. He was still the
leading financier of the country. The business men could
not spare him, even if the government had thrown him off.
There seems also to be some evidence that he hoped that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
great and universal revulsion would force the general government
to re-charter his Bank. The success of his post notes
in England and France was another source of gratified
vanity to him. In his theory of banking he was one of
those who believe that the redemption of the bank note is
effected by the merchandise. Hence banking was, for him,
an art by which the banker regulated commerce through
expansions and contractions of the circulation according to
the circumstances which he might observe in the market.</p>

<p>The first effect of the opposite courses taken by New York
and Philadelphia was very favorable to his views. The
southern trade was transferred from New York to Philadelphia.
Southern notes were at a discount of twenty or
twenty-five per cent. Receiving these notes from the
merchants, the Bank employed them through Bevan and
Humphreys in buying cotton. This operation began in
July and was intended to move the cotton to Europe in
order to meet the post notes of the Bank when they should
become due. The firm of Biddle and Humphreys was also
formed and established at Liverpool as the agent of this
operation. In the extension of the transaction cotton was
bought and paid for by drafts on Bevan and Humphreys
of Philadelphia, which drafts were discounted by the
Bank. Biddle and Humphreys, having sold the cotton,
remitted the proceeds to Mr. Jandon, former cashier of the
Bank, sent to England as its agent in July. To all this it
must be added that the Bank assumed the function of
securing, for its producers, a good or fair price for cotton.
Jandon’s instructions were to protect the interests of the
bank, and “of the country at large.”</p>

<p>If the Bank had simply been a strong, sound bank, intent
on earning profits, it would have sent two or three
millions to Europe, selling exchange at one hundred and
twelve, and would not have suspended. The rest of the
story would then have been very different for all concerned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
The arrival in June of a ship in England with one
hundred thousand dollars specie sufficed to sustain American
credit and to revive American securities. When the
credit of a debtor is tainted, nothing revives it like payment.</p>

<p>The extra session of Congress met on September 4. The
fourth installment of the State Deposit Fund was postponed
until January 1, 1839, but it was locked up in the
suspended banks and, as the former installments had been
drawn from the better banks, the balance due was all in
the worst banks of the country, those of the southwestern
states. As they had loaned it to their customers, it was,
in fact, amongst the people of those states. A law was
passed to institute suit against these banks unless they
paid on demand, or gave bonds to do so in three installments
before July 1, 1839. There were only six deposit banks
then paying specie; one was new, four had not suspended,
and one had resumed. Power to call on the states for the
funds “deposited” with them was taken from the Secretary
of the Treasury and held by Congress. Interest-bearing
Treasury notes were provided for one year, to
meet expenses, and an extension of nine months was
given on duty bonds. At this session the sub-treasury
system was brought forward as an administration measure.
It split the party. The “bank democrats” (state bank
interest which joined the Jackson party in 1832 to break
down the United States Bank) went into opposition. The
advocates of the “credit system” said the sub-treasury
scheme, by giving the government control of the specie in
the country, would give it control of all credit. Meanwhile
Benton said that the eighty million specie in the country
was its bulwark against adversity, and the Locofocos
said that any one who exported specie was a British hireling.
So that there was a fine confusion of financial notions.</p>

<p>In the fall the English money market became much
easier, and the same tendency appeared here. Specie at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
New York was at about seven per cent premium, but steadily
declining. Prices of breadstuffs remained very high (flour
nine dollars to nine dollars and a half at New York) and
the stagnation of industry was complete. Migration to
the West was large.</p>

<p>On August 18 the New York banks called a convention
of banks to deliberate on resumption. The Philadelphia
banks frustrated the proposition by refusing. A convention
met in October but adjourned without action until
April. On the 7th of April the New York banks had
assets two and a half times their liabilities, excluding
real estate, and were creditors of the Philadelphia banks
for $1,200,000. They had reduced their liabilities from
$25,400,000 on January 1, 1837 to $12,900,000 on January
1, 1838, and the foreign exchanges were favorable.</p>

<p>The bank convention met April 1, 1838, and voted by
states to resume January 1, 1839, without precluding an
earlier day. New York and Mississippi alone voted nay,
the former because the date was too remote; the latter
because it was too early. New England joined Philadelphia
and Baltimore for the later day. Mr. Biddle published
another letter in which he blamed the rigor of the contraction
at New York; he wanted to remain “prepared to
resume but not resuming,” and looked to Congress to do
the work. The exchange between New York and Philadelphia
was then four and a half per cent against the latter.
The southwestern exchanges were growing worse. On May
1, the Philadelphia banks resolved to pay specie for demands
under one dollar. The Bank of England engaged
to send one million pounds in specie to support resumption,
and did send one hundred thousand pounds, but then
receded from the undertaking; its stock of specie was now
very large and increasing. The New York banks resumed
during the first week in May, the Boston and New England
banks generally at the same time. Specie was coming into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
New York. On May 31 Congress repealed the specie
circular, whereupon Mr. Biddle published another letter
saying that since Congress had acted, he saw his way to
resumption and would “coöperate.” The Bank had, at this
time, over thirteen millions loaned on “bills receivable,”
that is, on securities put in the teller’s drawer, as cash to
replace cash taken out.</p>

<p>After the adjournment of Congress on July 9 there was
a much better feeling, especially on account of the defeat
of the sub-treasury bill, and on July 10, Governor Ritner
of Pennsylvania published a proclamation requiring the
banks to resume on August 13, and to pay and withdraw
all notes under five dollars. On July 23 a bank convention
composed of delegates from the middle states met at
Philadelphia. It was agreed to resume on August 13.
The Philadelphia banks were obliged to contract very suddenly
and money was very dear there. As soon as they
resumed there were demands on them from New York, exchange
being against them. This caused excitement and
indignation. The banks generally declared dividends as
soon as they resumed. Elsewhere, here and in England,
money was easy and the times rapidly improving. There
was, however, a feverish and uncertain market for cotton.
Biddle and Humphreys were carrying an immense stock,
and buyers and sellers differed as to prices.</p>

<p>On December 10, 1838, Biddle published another letter
to Adams in which he reviewed his policy of the last two
years, and withdrew the Bank from all its former public
activity. He says: “It abdicates its involuntary power.”
He defended the cotton speculations, saying that he had
saved the great staple of our country from being sacrificed,
by introducing a new competitor into the market. Here
then was a buyer who had gone into the market on purpose
to “bull” some one else’s property. His fate could not
be very doubtful. At this same time the Liverpool market<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
was very dull and the spinners were curtailing their demands
because the supply was under the control of speculators.
It was true, as was asserted, that the crop was
short, but the buyers took this for a speculator’s story,
and, anticipating a break in the corner and a fall in price,
they refused to buy. The speculation no doubt unduly
depressed the price. The southwestern agents of the Bank
of the United States were offering advances of from two
to five cents above the market price to secure consignments
to Biddle and Humphreys, and Mr. Jandon, because he had
lost instead of winning confidence, was paying ruinous rates
for money to carry on his operations.</p>

<p>During the winter most of the southern and western
banks resumed, at least nominally, but as the spring of 1839
approached the southern exchanges again fell and many of
the banks suspended again. On March 29 Biddle resigned
the presidency of the Bank, saying that he left it strong and
prosperous. The stock fell from one hundred and sixteen
to one hundred and twelve, but soon recovered. The
money market became stringent again, influenced by fears
of the South.</p>

<p>In March, by speculative sales, by the diminution of
stock, and by the real shortness of the crop, cotton was
forced up one and one-fourth pence at Liverpool, and
Biddle and Humphreys sold out their entire stock. The
net profit was six hundred thousand dollars. This was regarded
as a great triumph, and as a complete vindication
of Biddle’s policy. In July, 1839, the Bank of the United
States paid a semi-annual dividend of four per cent—its
last one.</p>

<p>The success of the cotton speculation led to a plan for
renewing it on a grander scale. On June 6, an unsigned
circular was published at New York, which proposed a
scheme for advancing three-fourths of the value at fourteen
cents on all cotton consigned to Biddle and Humphreys.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
They were to “hold on until prices vigorously rally.” The
agent, Mr. Wilder, declared that this had nothing to do with
the United States Bank, so far as he knew. It was, however,
a scheme of the Bank. The Southwestern notes were
falling lower and lower, and the post notes issued in the
Southwest the year before were now falling due, and were
not paid. The pressure of this fell on Philadelphia, where
money was up to fifteen per cent and the banks were curtailing.
The news from England was also bad. Cotton was
down two cents. The specie of the Bank of England was
rapidly declining and money was at five per cent. The
arrangements from this side in 1837 had simply consisted
in renewals or extensions, and as yet few payments had
been made. Stocks, etc., were sent over, but they fell
upon a glutted and stringent market and the prices declined.
These securities therefore did not furnish means of
payment, and specie shipments were found to be necessary.
The Bank of the United States had prevented any
shipment of specie by offering all the bills demanded at
one hundred and nine and a half, and Mr. Jandon had
been obliged to adopt the most reckless means to meet
these bills. In August he wrote to Biddle and Humphreys
to supply him with money at any sacrifice of cotton. “Life
or death to the Bank of the United States is the issue.”
The Bank here urged Bevan and Humphreys to direct
their agents to meet Jandon’s demands and the Bank
assumed the loss. In August the Bank sent an agent
to New York, to draw all the bills he could sell on
Hottinguer at Paris, to draw the proceeds in specie from
the New York banks, and to ship it to meet the bills,
the object being to force the New York banks to suspend
in order that their example might again be quoted.
The Bank also sold its post notes at a discount of eighteen
per cent per annum in Boston, New York, Baltimore, and
smaller places, and gathered up capital to meet the emergency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
at Philadelphia caused by the failure of the Southern
remittances. The money markets in all these cities were
very stringent until October. On the ninth of that month
the Bank of the United States failed on drafts from New
York, and on the tenth the news was received that the
drafts on Hottinguer had been protested. He had given
notice that he would not pay unless he was covered, and the
drafts arrived before the specie did. Jandon succeeded in
getting Rothschild to take up the bills. The amount was
seven million francs.</p>

<p>The banks south and west of New York and some of
the Rhode Island banks now suspended again. Specie
at Philadelphia was at one hundred and seven to one
hundred and seven and one-half. United States Bank
stock at seventy. On October 15, it was at eighty, and
sold at New York at one-fourth premium. Scarcely any
New York City notes were in circulation.</p>

<p>This suspension was the real catastrophe of the speculative
period which preceded. A great and general liquidation
now began. Perhaps as many as two hundred of
these banks never resumed. The stagnation of industry
lasted for three or four years. The public improvements
so rashly begun were suspended or abandoned. The
states were struggling with the debts contracted. Some
repudiated; some suspended the payment of interest.
The New England states and New York escaped all the
harsher features of this depression and emerged from it
first. In proportion as we go further south and west we
find the distress more intense and more prolonged. The
recovery was never marked by any distinct point of time,
but came gradually and imperceptibly.</p>

<p>The credit of the Bank of the United States bore up
wonderfully under the shock of its second suspension. Its
friends were ready to attribute its misfortunes to conspiracies,
jealousy, or any other cause but its own faults.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
They did not indeed know its internal history. It might
have recovered if it had not been ruined from within.
The cotton speculations showed a loss, in the summer of
1840, after saddling the Bank with all possible charges,
of $630,000 for the speculators. The legislature of Pennsylvania
ordered the banks to resume January 15, 1841. On
the first of January, 1841, a statement of the assets of the
Bank was made, when it appeared that they consisted of a
mass of doubtful and worthless securities. The losses to
date were over five millions, according to the report of the
directors, but over seventeen millions, taking the stocks at
their market value. The Bank resumed January 15,
with the other Philadelphia banks, and the great Bank
loaned the state four hundred thousand dollars, agreeing
to loan as much more. In twenty days the Philadelphia
banks lost eleven millions in specie, of which six millions
were taken from the Bank of the United States. On
February 4 the Bank failed for the third and last time.
Its final failure was said to be due to stock jobbers. Suits
were at once begun in such numbers that all hope of ever
resuscitating it had to be abandoned. Its deposits, when
it failed, were one million one hundred thousand dollars
and its notes in circulation two million eight hundred thousand
dollars. Twenty-seven millions out of the thirty-five
of its capital were held in Europe. The stock, in March,
1841, was at seventeen. A committee of the stockholders
reported in April, showing the internal history of the
Bank for five years. This brought out from Mr. Biddle
six letters of explanation, defense, and recrimination, which
are valuable chiefly for the further insight they give into
the history. As to the winding up of the Bank it is very
difficult to obtain information. Private inquiries lead to
the following results. Three trusts were constituted: one
for the city banks to which the Bank owed five or six
millions; one for the note-holders and depositors; and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
for the other creditors. The city banks, the note-holders,
and the depositors were ultimately paid in full. The other
claims were bought up by one or two persons who took the
assets. What they made of them is not matter of history.</p>

<p>The attempt of the Pennsylvania banks to resume in
January, 1841, had been the signal for similar attempts
in the other states. The banks on the seaboard as far
south as South Carolina generally resumed, and in the
Western and Gulf states some took the same step. All
were indebted to the Northeast, and were asked to pay as
soon as they said they were ready to pay. Like the Philadelphia
banks they succumbed to this demand. The
Virginia banks held out until April, when the suspension
was once more universal south of New York.</p>

<p>All the states except New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, and Delaware had debts, amounting
in all to nearly two hundred millions. The Southern
States had generally contracted these debts to found banks.
The Middle and Western States had contracted debts for
public works. In the former case the profits of the banks
were expected to cover the interest on the debt. In the
latter case the works were expected to be remunerative in
a short time, and the interest was provided for in the meantime
by bank dividends (on stocks owned by the state,
which only constituted another debt), by taxes on banks,
and by royalties. Both schemes were plausible and might
have been successful if managed with good judgment and
moderation. Under the actual circumstances they were
subject to political control, the methods of which were
reckless and ignorant. The consequence was that when
credit collapsed and the English market no longer absorbed
the state stocks with avidity, the states found themselves
heavily indebted, bound to pay large interest charges,
and without the anticipated revenue. The state banks
of the South had loaned their borrowed capital to legislators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
and politicians, and had no assets but “suspended
debt.” The improvement states had become heavily
indebted to their own banks and depended on bank dividends
to pay interest. The state banks all held state
stocks as assets, and when these declined in value, the
banks became insolvent. Thus the banking system was
interlocked with the state finances and with the mania for
improvements unwisely planned and attempted without
reference to the capital at command. The aversion to
taxation was very strong, and as taxation was delayed,
one state after another defaulted on its interest. The
delinquent states were Pennsylvania (which laid taxes in
1840, but inadequate to meet the deficiency), Michigan
(of which the Bank of the United States held two millions
in bonds not paid for when it failed), Mississippi (of which
the same bank held five millions in bonds the obligation
of which was disputed and never met), Indiana (whose
debt was one-fifth of the total valuation), Illinois, Louisiana,
Maryland and Arkansas, and Florida territory—total
amount, one hundred and eleven millions. In five
years the Bank of the United States gave to Pennsylvania
three millions, subscribed nearly half a million to
public improvements by corporations, and loaned the state
eight and one-half millions. In 1857–1858 Pennsylvania
sold out her works, which had cost thirty-five millions, for
eleven millions. The bonds deposited in New York to
secure circulation had a par value of four and six-tenths
millions, but were worth only one and six-tenths millions
on the first of January, 1843. As early as March, 1841,
this decline caused a panic in “Safety Fund” and “Free
Bank” notes at New York.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania now entered on another experiment which
threatened to ruin her remaining banks as the reckless demands
on the Bank of the United States had helped to ruin
that institution. On May 3, 1841, the legislature passed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
over a veto, a “Relief Act.” The object was to secure a
loan of three millions from the banks. The Act allowed
them to issue that amount in small notes which they were
to subscribe to a five per cent loan. They were to redeem
the notes in five per cent stock on demand in amounts
over one hundred dollars. The stocks were then at eighty
and specie at seven per cent premium.</p>

<p>The best financial writer in the country at that time
(Gouge) said of this Act: Pennsylvania, “after having borrowed
as much as she could in the old-fashioned way from
banks and brokers, and domestic and foreign capitalists, resolved
to extort a loan of a dollar a head from every washerwoman
and woodsawyer and everybody else within her
limits who had a dollar to lend. But as washerwomen and
woodsawyers and other dollar people cannot long dispense
with the use of their funds, it was necessary to give these
certificates of loan in a circulating form, so that the
burden might be shifted from one to another day by day,
or, if necessary, two or three times a day.”</p>

<p>The summer of 1841 was marked by intense distress
in Pennsylvania. A table of the best investment stocks
of Philadelphia shows a shrinkage between August, 1838,
and August, 1841, from sixty million to three and one-half
millions. The wages class was exposed to the bitterest
poverty and distress. The Pennsylvanians attributed the
trouble to the want of a protective tariff. For a time,
in the autumn, the Relief notes seemed to act beneficially.
The banks took them and they circulated at par with the
rest of the state currency. In January, 1842, the Girard
Bank failed, and about the same time the Pennsylvania
and three others less important, and by March a crisis
was reached worse than anything which had preceded. A bill
was suddenly passed by the legislature commanding immediate
resumption. An amendment was proposed that
the banks should no longer be bound to receive the Relief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
notes, although the state should do so. The amendment
was afterwards withdrawn, but the Relief notes were ruined.
They fell, some to seventy-five and some to fifty in state
currency and then became merchandise, after six months
and three days of use. Capital was now not to be had
at four per cent per month, but this bankruptcy had
cleared the situation. The eleven banks which had not
failed agreed to resume on March 18. The exchanges with
New York turned in favor of Philadelphia. The years
1842 and 1843 were years of great depression. The banks
throughout the west and south were liquidating, after which
they either perished or resumed. From 1843 a new sound
and healthy development of industry and credit began.
The recovery, however, was very slow, and banks sprang
up again sooner and faster than anything else.</p>

<p>The total amount of Relief notes issued in Pennsylvania
was two and one tenth millions. In January, 1843, the
amount outstanding was, of depreciated $639,834, of
specie value (issued by banks which had resumed) $240,801.
Bicknell’s <cite>Reporter</cite> said: “If any one can devise an immediate
plan whereby the people can get rid of about $700,000
of paper trash, he will be entitled to the name of a public
benefactor.” In February, 1843, the Legislature ordered
the Treasurer to cancel $100,000 of Relief notes at once and
$100,000 monthly until all were destroyed, but in June,
1843, there were still $684,521 out.</p>

<p>This is certainly a melancholy story of the way in which
people who enjoy the most exceptional chances of wealth
and prosperity can squander them by ignorance of political
economy and recklessness in political management. Banks
were regarded as means of borrowing capital, not as institutions
for lending it. If there was anywhere a group
of needy speculators, they secured a bank charter, elected
themselves directors, gave their notes for the stock, printed
a lot of bank notes, loaned the notes to themselves, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
went out and with the notes bought the capital they
wanted. Bank after bank failed with an immense circulation
afloat and no assets but the notes of its directors,
who had failed too. When the United States had thirty
or forty millions surplus on hand and these banks could get
the custody and handling of it for an indefinite period,
because the country had no need for it, it can readily be
understood why banks multiplied. The banks were encouraged
to lend this deposit freely to the public, which they
were by no means loath to do, for that was the only way
to gain a profit on it. They lent it, not once but two or
three times over. The New York bank commissioners
pointed out the danger of a system in which the borrower
came directly into contact with the bank which issued the
currency. If a man was eager to borrow and pay high interest
and the bank had only to print the notes to accommodate
him, there was every stimulus to over-issue. If
the borrower engaged in any enterprise he raised the price
of everything he bought. When he became engaged in
his enterprise and wanted more capital, he went back to the
bank more eager and more ready to pay high interest than
ever, and the operation was repeated. In 1836, on the top
of the inflation, the rates for money were twelve and fifteen
per cent throughout the year, with a very tight money
market. The banks and the business community could not
throw the blame on each other. They stimulated each other
and went on in their folly hand in hand. The penalties,
however, were not fairly distributed. The banks “suspended,”
as they called it; that is, when asked to pay their
debts, they said they would not; and they enjoyed a complete
immunity in this respect, while people outside who
could not pay had to fail.</p>

<p>I have tried, within the limits to which I am bound, to
show how many elements were combined in this period
and how they were all interwoven. There are the political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
elements, the tariff element, the movement of population
to the new land, the fiscal operations of the general government,
the revolution in the coinage, the mania for public
improvements, the reckless creation of state debts, and the
war on the United States Bank. Any one of these might
have accounted for a financial crisis in an old country,
and the fact that the catastrophe produced by all combined
was not greater here is a striking proof of the vitality of
the country and the wonderful advantages which it was
wasting.</p>

<p>On the four or five years of inflated prosperity there
followed four or five years of the most slow and grinding
distress. 1843 is the year of lowest prices in our history,
and the year of severest restriction in industry. In 1842
the United States Treasury was under protest and actually
bankrupt, and American credit was so low that an agent of
the general government who was sent to Europe to try
to place a loan of only twelve million dollars there could
not do it at all. In that same year, however, out of what
income it did have, the general government distributed six
hundred thousand dollars, which came from land, amongst
the states. As for calling back any of the twenty-eight
millions deposited with the states, no effort of the kind
was ever made. The states were complaining that the
fourth installment, to which they had a right, had never
been paid to them. The question is sometimes mooted
whether a national debt is a curse or a blessing. There can
be no doubt whatever that a national surplus is a curse.</p>

<p>In the years before 1837 there had been a great deal of
eloquence spent upon “the credit system.” After 1837
this matter was dropped. By the credit system they meant
the multiplication of bank notes which were false promises.
The notion was that the system of using these in business
gave poor men an easier chance to get rich. At first they
were loaned easily at low rates. Then, as prices rose and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
speculation became active, interest advanced. The “poor
men” found themselves forced to submit to more and more
ruinous renewals, all the heavier because of the usury
law, until they lost all they had ever really owned. The
question, then, is how much better off than they were would
the poor men of 1830 have been in 1845 if they had gone
on slowly earning and saving capital and making no use of
credit at all. As it was, the poor men of 1830, after supposing
themselves rich in 1836, were all bankrupt in 1845.
Such is the course of every inflation of the currency. It is
proved by hundreds of instances; and there is no delusion
which it seems so hard to stamp out of the minds of men as
this, that in business we can make something out of nothing,
although we cannot in chemistry or mechanics. Nothing
more surely tempts the man without capital to his ruin
than the easy credit which accompanies the first stages of
inflation.</p>

<p>It is worth while also to reflect for a moment on the results
of the two plans for dealing with the crisis: the New York
plan and the Philadelphia plan. When an error has been
committed in this world, we always have to bear the penalty
for it. If we do not like the stripes on one side we can
turn and take them on the other, but when nature inflicts
penalties for her broken laws we never can squirm out
of the way. In this case, then, when the folly had been
perpetrated the punishment had to be suffered. The only
choice was whether to take it quick and heavy, or light
and long. The New Yorkers chose the former way. The
contraction was severe and painful while it lasted, but it
was soon over. From May, 1838, the New York banks
resumed and held on without further default and the New
York business recovered and entered upon a new course
of growth from that time. The Philadelphians took the
other course. They made it easy for the debtors and waited
for the storm to blow over. The consequence was that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
debts increased still further. The advantage in trade over
New York proved shortlived and terribly expensive, for
the goods were not paid for. The confusion and distress
lasted for four years longer than in New York, and the
total loss was very much greater. For the last five years
we have been under the same necessity as that which
oppressed the country in 1837. We have been following
the Philadelphia plan and I may give you my opinion that
we have not been wise. I think that we might have escaped
three years ago with far less loss, and might have
been three years further on the road to new prosperity.</p>

<p>In conclusion let me draw your attention to the lesson
of this history in regard to resumption. There was no
resumption, you see, until the currency had been reduced to
the limits of the actual specie necessity of the country or
even below it. Either voluntarily or by bankruptcy the
redundant paper had to be withdrawn. Such has been
the case in every other instance of resumption that I know
of, which has been real and permanent. Applying this to
our own present circumstances I ask myself whether the
amount of paper now in circulation is in excess of the requirement
of the country, and there seems to me every
reason to believe that it is. If that is so, resumption
cannot be real and permanent until a portion of it has
been redeemed and withdrawn. The interest in resumption
of the great body of industrious, sober, and thrifty citizens
cannot be exaggerated. Renewed prosperity on a solid
basis is impossible until after a complete return to specie
value. There are those, however, who want to live by
anything but honest labor, who find their best chance
when prices are fluctuating and currency is continually
changing in value. They have schemes and interests
which resumption must destroy. They have done all
they could to make it fail and they are watchful and eager
to see it fail. If it does fail it will be a great national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
calamity, on account of the authority which it will offer
to these prophets of evil if for no other reason. Resumption
with us now stands at just that point where the
lightest preponderance of force may turn it one way or the
other—may insure its success or cause its failure. It is
a great gain to get our faces set in the right direction. It
arouses the national pride in the success of resumption.
It silences opposition and malevolent efforts against it.
It makes it very much easier to take the requisite steps
to insure success, for they involve no pain at all, nothing
but economy and prudence in the national finances; the
avoidance of unnecessary expenditure and the postponement
for a time of certain expenditures proper in themselves.
If the country needs six hundred million dollars
to do its business with, then the withdrawal of a portion
of the paper would simply bring gold into circulation, and
resumption would be placed beyond a doubt. If the
country does not want six hundred million dollars to do
its business with, then we cannot sustain specie payments
with that amount afloat, and we have still before us more
of the experience of 1842 and 1843.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SCIENCE_OF_SOCIOLOGY58">THE SCIENCE OF SOCIOLOGY<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor smaller">58</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the present state of the science of sociology the man
who has studied it at all is very sure to feel great self-distrust
in trying to talk about it. The most that one of
us can do at the present time is to appreciate the promise
which the science offers to us, and to understand the lines
of direction in which it seems about to open out. As for
the philosophy of the subject, we still need the master to
show us how to handle and apply its most fundamental
doctrines. I have the feeling all the time, in studying and
teaching sociology, that I have not mastered it yet in such
a way as to be able to proceed in it with good confidence
in my own steps. I have only got so far as to have an
almost overpowering conviction of the necessity and value
of the study of that science.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer addressed himself at the outset of his literary
career to topics of sociology. In the pursuit of those
topics he found himself forced (as I understand it) to seek
constantly more fundamental and wider philosophical
doctrines. He came at last to fundamental principles of
the evolution philosophy. He then extended, tested, confirmed,
and corrected these principles by inductions from
other sciences, and so finally turned again to sociology,
armed with the scientific method which he had acquired.
To win a powerful and correct method is, as we all know,
to win more than half the battle. When so much is secured,
the question of making the discoveries, solving the
problems, eliminating the errors, and testing the results,
is only a question of time and of strength to collect and
master the data.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span></p>

<p>We have now acquired the method of studying sociology
scientifically so as to attain to assured results. We have
acquired it none too soon. The need for a science of life
in society is urgent, and it is increasing every year. It is
a fact which is generally overlooked that the great advance
in the sciences and the arts which has taken place during
the last century is producing social consequences and giving
rise to social problems. We are accustomed to dwell
upon the discoveries of science and the development of
the arts as simple incidents, complete in themselves, which
offer only grounds for congratulation. But the steps
which have been won are by no means simple events.
Each one has consequences which reach beyond the domain
of physical power into social and moral relations, and these
effects are multiplied and reproduced by combination with
each other. The great discoveries and inventions redistribute
population. They reconstruct industries and force
new organization of commerce and finance. They bring
new employments into existence and render other employments
obsolete, while they change the relative value of
many others. They overthrow the old order of society,
impoverishing some classes and enriching others. They
render old political traditions grotesque and ridiculous, and
make old maxims of statecraft null and empty. They
give old vices of human nature a chance to parade in new
masks, so that it demands new skill to detect the same old
foes. They produce a kind of social chaos in which contradictory
social and economic phenomena appear side by
side to bewilder and deceive the student who is not fully
armed to deal with them. New interests are brought into
existence, and new faiths, ideas, and hopes, are engendered
in the minds of men. Some of these are doubtless good
and sound; others are delusive; in every case a competent
criticism is of the first necessity. In the upheaval of society
which is going on, classes and groups are thrown against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
each other in such a way as to produce class hatreds and
hostilities. As the old national jealousies, which used to
be the lines on which war was waged, lose their distinctness,
class jealousies threaten to take their place. Political and
social events which occur on one side of the globe now
affect the interests of population on the other side of the
globe. Forces which come into action in one part of human
society rest not until they have reached all human
society. The brotherhood of man is coming to be a reality
of such distinct and positive character that we find it
a practical question of the greatest moment what kind of
creatures some of these hitherto neglected brethren are.
Secondary and remoter effects of industrial changes, which
were formerly dissipated and lost in the delay and friction
of communication, are now, by our prompt and delicate
mechanism of communication, caught up and transmitted
through society.</p>

<p>It is plain that our social science is not on the level of
the tasks which are thrown upon it by the vast and sudden
changes in the whole mechanism by which man makes the
resources of the globe available to satisfy his needs, and
by the new ideas which are born of the new aspects which
human life bears to our eyes in consequence of the development
of science and the arts. Our traditions about the
science and art of living are plainly inadequate. They
break to pieces in our hands when we try to apply them
to the new cases. A man of good faith may come to the
conviction sadly, but he must come to the conviction
honestly, that the traditional doctrines and explanations
of human life are worthless.</p>

<p>A progress which is not symmetrical is not true; that
is to say, every branch of human interest must be developed
proportionately to all the other branches, else the
one which remains in arrears will measure the advance
which may be won by the whole. If, then, we cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
produce a science of life in society which is broad enough
to solve all the new social problems which are now forced
upon us by the development of science and art, we shall
find that the achievements of science and art will be overwhelmed
by social reactions and convulsions.</p>

<p>We do not lack for attempts of one kind and another
to satisfy the need which I have described. Our discussion
is in excess of our deliberation, and our deliberation
is in excess of our information. Our journals, platforms,
pulpits, and parliaments are full of talking and writing
about topics of sociology. The only result, however, of
all this discussion is to show that there are half a dozen
arbitrary codes of morals, a heterogeneous tangle of economic
doctrines, a score of religious creeds and ecclesiastical
traditions, and a confused jumble of humanitarian
and sentimental notions which jostle each other in the
brains of the men of this generation. It is astonishing to
watch a discussion and to see how a disputant, starting
from a given point of view, will run along on one line of
thought until he encounters some fragment of another
code or doctrine, which he has derived from some other
source of education; whereupon he turns at an angle, and
goes on in a new course until he finds himself face to face
with another of his old prepossessions. What we need is
adequate criteria by which to make the necessary tests
and classifications, and appropriate canons of procedure,
or the adaptation of universal canons to the special tasks
of sociology.</p>

<p>Unquestionably it is to the great philosophy which
has now been established by such ample induction in the
experimental sciences, and which offers to man such new
command of all the relations of life, that we must look
for the establishment of the guiding lines in the study of
sociology. I can see no boundaries to the scope of the
philosophy of evolution. That philosophy is sure to embrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
all the interests of man on this earth. It will be
one of its crowning triumphs to bring light and order into
the social problems which are of universal bearing on all
mankind. Mr. Spencer is breaking the path for us into
this domain. We stand eager to follow him into it, and
we look upon his work on sociology as a grand step in the
history of science. When, therefore, we express our earnest
hope that Mr. Spencer may have health and strength to
bring his work to a speedy conclusion, we not only express
our personal respect and good-will for himself, but also
our sympathy with what, I doubt not, is the warmest wish
of his own heart, and our appreciation of his great services
to true science and to the welfare of mankind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTEGRITY_IN_EDUCATION59">INTEGRITY IN EDUCATION<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor smaller">59</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> addressing you on the present occasion, I am naturally
led to speak of matters connected with education. We
are met here amid surroundings which, to the great majority
of us, are unfamiliar, but we are assembled in the
atmosphere of our school days and under the inspiration
of school memories. Some of us are rapidly approaching,
if we have not already reached, the time when our interest
in education re-arises in behalf of the next generation.
Many are engaged in the work of teaching. Others have
only just finished a stage in their education. I therefore
propose to speak for a few minutes about integrity in education,
believing that it is a subject of great importance
at the present time, and one which may justly command
your interest.</p>

<p>By integrity in education, I mean the opposite of all
sensationalism and humbug in education. I would include
under it as objects to be aimed at in education, not
only the pursuit of genuine and accurate information and
wide knowledge of some technical branch of study, but
also real discipline in the use of mental powers, sterling
character, good manners, and high breeding.</p>

<p>Modern sensationalism is conquering a wide field for
itself. It is a sort of parasite on high civilization. Its
motto is that seeming is as good as being. Its intrinsic
fault is its hollowness, insincerity, and falsehood. It deals
in dash, flourish, and meretricious pretense. It resides in
the form, not in the substance; in the outward appearance,
not in the reality. It arouses disgust whenever it is perceived;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
but the worst of it is that its forms are so various,
its manifestations are sometimes so delicate, and it often
lies so near to the real and the true, that is it difficult to
distinguish it. Life hurries past us very rapidly. The
interests which demand our attention are very numerous
and important. We have not time to scrutinize them all.
Then, too, the publicity of everything nowadays prevents
modest retirement from being a sign of merit. We go on
the principle that if anything is good, it is for the public.
Publicity is honorable and proper recognition, and those
who have charge of the public trumpets have not time, if
they have the ability, to discriminate and criticize very
closely.</p>

<p>These reflections account sufficiently for the growth of
sensationalism in general. Probably each one sees the
mischief which it does in his own circle or profession more
distinctly than elsewhere. I have certainly been struck
by its influence on education. I see it in common-school
education as well as in the universities. It attaches to
methods as well as to subjects. It develops a dogmatism
of its own. Men without education, or experience as
teachers, often take up the pitiful rôle of another class
which has come to be called “educators.” They start off
with a whim or two which they elaborate into theories of
education. These they propound with great gravity in
speech and writing, producing long discussions as to plans
and methods. They are continually searching for a patent
method of teaching, or a royal road to learning, when, in
fact, the only way to learn is by the labor of the mind in
observing, comparing, and generalizing, and any patent
method which avoids this irksome labor produces sham
results and fails of producing the mental power and discipline
of which education consists.</p>

<p>Persons of this class are generally impatient until they
have attained some opportunity of putting their notions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
in practice, and then it is all over with any institution
which becomes subject to their wild empiricism.</p>

<p>The saddest results of such proceedings are seen, of
course, in the pupils. That a certain school should lose
its pupils, or fall into debt, or be closed, is a comparatively
small affair. The real mischief is that men should be produced
who have no real education, but only a perverse
training in putting forward plausible and meretricious
appearances. Such education falls in with the outward
phenomena of a sensational era and strengthens the impressions
which a young and inexperienced observer gets
from our modern society, that audacity is the chief of
talents, that success or failure is the only measure of right
or wrong, that the man to be admired is the one who invents
clever tricks to circumvent a rival or opponent, or
to skip over a troublesome principle. Young people are
more acute in their observations, and they draw inferences
and form generalizations more logically and consistently
than their elders. They have not yet learned respect for
dogmas, traditions, and conventionalities, and their “education”
goes on silently but surely, developing a philosophy
of life either of one kind or another. If, therefore, you
have an educational system consisting of formal cram for
recitation or examination, if there is a skimming of text-books,
an empty acquisition of terms, a memorizing of
results only, you may pursue high-sounding studies and
“cover a great deal of ground,” you may have an elaborate
curriculum and boast of your proficiency in difficult
branches, but you will have no education. You may
produce men who can spend a lifetime dawdling over
trifles, or men who always scatter their force when they
try to think, but you will not have intelligent men with
minds well-disciplined and well under control, who are
able to apply their full force to any new exigency, or any
new problem, and to grasp and conquer it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span></p>

<p>The fault here is plain enough. People forget, or do not
perceive, that simplicity and modesty are the first requisites
in scientific pursuits. We have to begin humbly and with
small beginnings if we want to go far. Inflation and pretense
only lead to vanity and dilletantism, not to strength
and fruitful activity. If we advance eagerly, we deceive
ourselves by the notion that we are making grand progress.
We are only leaving much undone which we shall have to
go back and repair. If, on the other hand, we proceed
slowly and with painstaking, every step of advance is sure
and genuine. It forms a great vantage-ground for the
next step. It strengthens and confirms the mental powers.
They come to act with certainty by scientific processes,
not by guesses, and this mental discipline enables us to
apply our powers wherever we need them. A new task
is not a dead wall which is impassable to us because we have
never seen one like it before. It is only a new case for the
application of old and familiar processes. I never see anything
more pitiable than the helpless floundering in a new
subject of a young man far on in his education who has
never yet learned to use his mind.</p>

<p>In what I have already said about the philosophy of life
which a young person forms during the process of education,
I have suggested that education must exert a great
influence on character. It is sometimes asserted that
education ought to mold character—ought to have that
object and work towards it, of set purpose. I do not deny
this, but I beg you to observe that it obscures the truth.
The truth is that education inevitably forms character one
way or the other. The error is in speaking as if academical
instruction could be carried on without training character,
unless the set purpose were entertained. One might read
many books on mathematics and the sciences without any
very direct moral culture, but everything we learn about
this world in which we live reacts in some sort of principle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
for the regulation of our conduct here. This, however, is
not the most important thing. A school is a miniature
society. Do we not all know how it forms an atmosphere
of its own, how the members make a code of their own,
and a public opinion of their own? And then, what a
position the teacher holds in this little community. What
a dangerous and responsible eminence he occupies. What
criticism he undergoes. What an authority his example
exerts. So, in this little society, general notions of conduct
are unconsciously formed, principles are adopted,
habits grow. Every member in his place gives to, and takes
from, the common life. It may be well doubted whether
there is any association of life which exerts greater influence
on character than does the school, and its influence comes,
too, just as the formative period, when impressions are
most easily received and sink deepest.</p>

<p>Here then is where sensationalism may do its greatest
harm, and where integrity of method is most important.
The untruthfulness of sensationalism here becomes a germinal
principle, which develops into manifold forms of untruthfulness
in character. Young people cannot practice
show and pretense and yet be taught to believe that the
only important thing is what you are, and not at all what
people think about you. They cannot practice the devices
which give a semblance of learning, and yet be taught to
believe that shams are disgraceful and that the frank
honesty which owns the worst is a noble trait. They may
learn to be ashamed when caught in a false pretense, but
they will not learn shame at deceit. I do not say that
they will lie or steal, but it is a pitiful code which defines
honesty as refraining from seizing other people’s property.
Honesty is a far wider virtue than not-stealing. It embraces
rectitude of motive and purpose, completeness and
consistency of principle, and delicacy of responsibility.
Truthfulness is the very cornerstone of character, and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
instinct of dislike for whatever is false or meretricious is
one of the feelings which all sound education must inculcate.
It cannot do so, however, unless its <em>personnel</em> and
its methods are all animated by unflinching integrity.</p>

<p>I mentioned also, at the outset, amongst those things
which are embraced in education and to which I desire to
see the principle of integrity applied, good manners. Some
people make an ostentatious display of neglect for good
manners. They think it democratic, or a sign of good
fellowship, to be negligent in this respect. They think it
something to be boasted of that they have no breeding.
Some others make manners supersede education and
training and even character. It is the latter error which
most invades the sphere of education. We are familiar
with its forms. It gives us the mock gentleman of the
drawing-room under the same coat with the rowdy of the
bar-room. When this system triumphs, it fits our young
people out with a few fashionable phrases, which suffice for
the persiflage of the drawing-room, when a scientific subject
by chance comes up. Girls are the victims of this
system far more than boys, but in “cultivated circles”
cases are common of this kind, in which a smattering of
books has been engrafted on the culture of the dancing
school. Young men and young women who have tacked
together a few miscellaneous phrases current amongst the
learned will deliver you their opinions roundly on the
gravest problems of philosophy and science. The phrases
which stick in their minds the longest are those which
are epigrammatic and paradoxical, whether true or not.
In fact, they could not analyze or criticize their mental
stock if they should try. They have never learned to consider
a subject and form an opinion.</p>

<p>It does not follow, however, that boorishness is erudition,
or that it does not belong to education to teach the
good manners which are good simply because they are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
spontaneous expression of a sound heart and a well-trained
mind. Envy, malice, and selfishness are the usual springs
of bad manners. They belong to the untrained and brutish
man, and it is the province of true education to eradicate
them. Hence it is that where true education is
wanting we may often find the worst manners with the
greatest social experience, and the truest courtesy where
there has been genuine discipline, but little acquaintance
with social forms.</p>

<p>I have not started this train of thought in order to tell
you now that we have enjoyed the true method of education,
and that others have not, but there are some things
connected with this institution which we may remember
with pleasure in view of the reflections which I have
presented.</p>

<p>This school was founded so long ago that it already has
a body of graduates who are useful and influential men in
this city, and many others are scattered up and down the
country, useful and honorable, if not celebrated citizens.
It was not founded without some struggle, but the more
enlightened views prevailed and the results have vindicated
those views, I suppose to the satisfaction of everybody.
The enterprise enjoyed at the outset the patronage
of a body of men of remarkably broad views and sound
public spirit. We who profited by its instruction in our
time may properly remember those men on this occasion
with gratitude and respect. One of them, surpassed by
none in zeal to work for and intelligence to plan such an
institution, has only just passed away. Your city has been
fortunate in possessing such citizens.</p>

<p>The plan on which the school was founded was remarkably
wise and farseeing. It has placed the highest education
within the reach of every boy in your city who had
sufficient industry and self-denial to seek it. Many of you
are now in the position of active and responsible citizens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
You must regard this institution as one of the boasts of
your city. Guard it well. You may not boast of it only.
You owe it a debt which you must pay. Every boy and
girl who has graduated here owes a debt to the common
school system of America. Every man for whom this
school has opened a career which would otherwise have
been beyond his reach, owes a tenfold debt, both to the
common school system and to the class in which he was
born. Sectarian interests, private school interests, property
interests, and some cliques of “culture” falsely so
called, are rallying against the system a force which people
as yet underrate. There is no knowing how soon the
struggle may open, and you may be called upon to pay the
allegiance you owe.</p>

<p>This school has also been remarkably fortunate in the
selection of the teachers who have presided over it. We
cannot exaggerate the value of this selection. It is by the
imperceptible influence of the teacher’s character and example
that the atmosphere of a school is created. It is
from this that the pupils learn what to admire and what
to abhor, what to seek and what to shun. It is from this
that they learn what methods of action are honorable and
what ones are unbecoming. They learn all this from
methods of discipline as well as from methods of instruction.
They may learn craft and intrigue, or they may
learn candor and sincerity. They may learn to win success
at any cost, or they may learn to accept failure with
dignity, when success could only be won by dishonor.</p>

<p>You know well what has always been the tone impressed
on this institution by the teachers we had here. We had
many, both gentlemen and ladies, whom we remember
with respect and affection. Our later experience of the
world and of life has only served to show us more distinctly,
in the retrospect, how elevated was their tone,
how sincere their devotion, how simple and upright their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
methods of dealing with us. They were not taskmasters
to us, and their work was not a harsh and ungrateful routine
to them.</p>

<p>One figure will inevitably arise before the minds of all
when these words are said, the figure of one who died with
the harness on. I have never seen anywhere, in my experience,
a man of more simple and unconscious high-breeding,
one who combined more thoroughly the dignity
of official authority with the suavity of unrestrained intercourse
with his pupils. It is a part of the good fortune
which came to us and to this city from this institution that
so many young people here enjoyed his personal influence.</p>

<p>It follows, as a natural consequence, from these facts,
that we enjoyed here to a high degree what I have described
as integrity in education. Sensationalism of any kind has
always been foreign to the system here. It must perish
in such an atmosphere. We had instruction which was real
and solid, which conceded nothing to show and sacrificed
nothing to applause. We learned to work patiently for
real and enduring results. We learned the faith that
what is genuine must outlast and prevail over what is
meretricious. We learned to despise empty display. We
had also a discipline which was complete and sufficient,
but which was attained without friction. There was no
sentimentality, no petting, no affectation of free and easy
manners. Discipline existed because it was necessary, and
it was smooth because it was reasonable.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing to which people apply more severe
criticism, as they grow old, than to their education. They
find the need of it every day, and they have to ask whether
it was sufficient and suited to the purpose or not. It is
because we find, I think, that our education here does
stand this test that we are able to meet here on an occasion
like this with genuine interest and sympathy. The years
in their flight have scattered us and brought us weighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
cares and new interests. We could not lay these aside to
come back here for purposes of mere sentiment, or to repeat
conventional phrases. We meet on the ground of
grateful recollection of benefits received, benefits which we
can specify and weigh and measure.</p>

<p>This school must be regarded as a local institution. It
belongs to this city and its advantages are offered to the
young people who grow up here. I have referred to the
exceptional wisdom and enlightenment which presided over
its foundation and have nourished its growth. In conclusion,
let me refer to what concerns its present and its
future. We are reminded by all we see about us here that
its building and its appliances are far better than they were
in our day. Its prosperity bears witness to its present
good management. But, gentlemen, these good things are
not to be preserved without vigilance and labor. The
same wisdom and enlightenment must preside over the
future as over the past. I doubt not that the value of this
institution to your city is so fully appreciated, and the
methods by which it has been developed are so well understood,
that any peril to it or to them would arouse your
earnest efforts for its defence. Keep it as it has been,
devoted to correct objects by sound methods. Sacrifice
nothing to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i> of hasty and false success. Concede
nothing to the modern quackery of education. Resist the
specious schemes of reckless speculators on educational
theories. It is not to be expected that you can escape these
dangers any more than other people, and you have to be
on your guard against them. You want here an educational
institution which shall, in its measure, instruct your children
in the best science and thought of the day. You want
it to make them masters of themselves and of their powers.
You want it to make them practical in the best and only
true sense, by making them efficient in dealing intelligently
with all the problems of life. The country needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
such citizens to-day. The state needs them. Your city
needs them. They are needed in all the trades and professions.
You must look to such institutions as this to
provide them, and you must keep it true to its methods
and purpose if you want it to turn out men of moral courage,
high principle, and devotion to duty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DISCIPLINE">DISCIPLINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> occurs very frequently to a person connected as a
teacher with a great seat of learning to meet persons
who, having completed a course of study and having spent
a few years in active life, are led to make certain reflections
upon their academical career. There is a great uniformity
in the comments which are thus made, so far as I
have heard them, and they enforce upon me certain convictions.
I observe that an academical life is led in a
community which is to a certain extent closed, isolated,
and peculiar. It has a code of its own as well for work as
for morals. It forms a peculiar standpoint, and life, as
viewed from it, takes on peculiar forms and peculiar colors.
It is scarcely necessary to add that the views of life thus
obtained are distorted and incorrect.</p>

<p>I should not expect much success if I should undertake
to correct those views by description in words. It is only
in life itself, that is, by experience, that men correct their
errors. They insist on making experience for themselves.
They delude themselves with hopes that they are peculiar
in their persons and characters, or that their circumstances
are peculiar, and so that in some way or other they can
perpetrate the old faults and yet escape the old penalties.
It is only when life is spent that these delusions are dispelled
and then the power and the opportunity to put the
acquired wisdom to practice is gone by. Thus the old
continually warn and preach and the young continually
disregard and suffer.</p>

<p>Although I could not expect better fortune than others
if I should thus preach, yet there are some things which,
as I have often been led to think, young men in your situation
might be brought to understand with great practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
advantage, and which, if you did understand them, and act
upon them, would save you from the deepest self-reproach
and regret which I so often hear older men express; and
the present occasion seems a better one than I can otherwise
obtain, for presenting those things. I allude to some
wider explanations of the meaning and purpose of academical
pursuits. I do not mean theories of education
about which people dispute, but I mean the purposes which
any true education has in view, and the responsibilities it
brings with it. It surely is not advisable that men of your
age should pursue your education as a mere matter of
routine, learning prescribed lessons, performing enforced
tasks, resisting, unintelligent, and uninterested. Such an
experience on your part would not constitute any true
education. It would not involve any development of
capability in you. It could only render you dull, fond of
shirking, slovenly in your work, and superficial in your
attainments. Unless I am greatly mistaken, some counteraction
to such a low and unworthy conception of academical
life may be secured by showing its relation to real life, and
attaching things pursued here to practical and enduring
benefits. I have known men to get those benefits without
knowing it; and I believe that you would get them
better if you got them intelligently, and that you would
appreciate them better if you got them consciously.</p>

<p>In the first place, it will be profitable to look at one or
two notions in regard to the purpose of education which
do not seem to be sound. One is that it is the purpose of
education to give special technical skill or dexterity and
to fit a man to get a living. We may admit at once that
the object of study is to get useful knowledge. It was,
indeed, the error of some old systems of academical pursuits
that they gave only a special dexterity and that too
in such a direction as the making of Greek and Latin verses,
which is a mere accomplishment and not a very good one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
at that. It must be ranged with dancing and fencing; it
is not as high as drawing, painting, or music. There is,
moreover, a domain in which special technical training is
proper. It is the domain of the industrial school, for giving
a certain theoretical knowledge of persons who will be
engaged for life in the mechanic arts. With this limitation,
however, we have at once given to us the bounds
which preclude this notion from covering the true conception
of an academic career. It does not simply provide
technical training for a higher class of arts which require
longer preparation. You know that this conception is
widely held through our American community, and that
it is laid down with great dogmatic severity by persons
who sometimes, unfortunately, are in a position to turn
their opinions into law. It is one of the great obstacles
against which all efforts for higher education amongst us
have to contend.</p>

<p>I pass on, however, to another opinion just now much
more fashionable and held by people who are, at any rate,
much more elegant than the supporters of the view just
mentioned, that is, the opinion that what we expect from
education is “culture.” Culture is a word which offers
us an illustration of the degeneracy of language. If I may
define culture, I have no objection to admitting that it is
the purpose of education to produce it; but since the word
came into fashion, it has been stolen by the dilettanti and
made to stand for their own favorite forms and amounts
of attainments. Mr. Arnold, the great apostle, if not the
discoverer, of culture, tried to analyze it and he found it to
consist of sweetness and light. To my mind, that is like
saying that coffee is milk and sugar. The stuff of culture
is all left out of it. So, in the practice of those who accept
this notion, culture comes to represent only an external
smoothness and roundness of outline without regard to
intrinsic qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span></p>

<p>We have got so far now as to begin to distinguish different
kinds of culture. There is chromo culture, of which
we heard much a little while ago, and there is bouffe culture,
which is only just invented. If I were in the way of it, I
should like to add another class, which might be called
sapolio culture, because it consists in putting a high polish
on plated ware. There seems great danger lest this kind
may come to be the sort aimed at by those who regard
culture as the end of education.</p>

<p>A truer idea of culture is that which regards it as equivalent
to training, or the result of training, which brings into
intelligent activity all the best powers of mind and body.
Such a culture is not to be attained by writing essays about
it, or by forming ever so clear a literary statement or
mental conception of what it is. It is not to be won by
wishing for it, or aping the external manifestations of it.
We men can get it only by industrious and close application
of the powers we want to develop. We are not sure
of getting it by reading any number of books. It requires
continual application of literary acquisitions to practice
and it requires a continual correction of mental conceptions
by observation of things as they are. For the sake
of distinguishing sharply between the true idea of culture
and the false, I have thought it better to call the true
culture discipline, a word which perhaps brings out its
essential character somewhat better.</p>

<p>Here let me call your attention to one very broad generalization
on human life which men continually lose sight
of, and of which culture is an illustration. The great and
heroic things which strike our imagination are never attainable
by direct efforts. This is true of wisdom, glory,
fame, virtue, culture, public good, or any other of the great
ends which men seek to attain. We cannot reach any of
these things by direct effort. They come as the refined
result, in a secondary and remote way, of thousands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
acts which have another and closer end in view. If a man
aims at wisdom directly, he will be very sure to make an
affectation of it. He will attain only to a ridiculous profundity
in commonplaces. Wisdom is the result of great
knowledge, experience, and observation, after they have
all been sifted and refined down into sober caution, trained
judgment, skill in adjusting means to ends.</p>

<p>In like manner, one who aims at glory or fame directly
will win only that wretched caricature which we call notoriety.
Glory and fame, so far as they are desirable things,
are remote results which come of themselves at the end of
long and repeated and able exertions.</p>

<p>The same holds true of the public good or the “cause,”
or whatever else we ought to call that end which fires the
zeal of philanthropists and martyrs. When this is pursued
directly as an immediate good, there arise extravagances,
fanaticisms, and aberrations of all kinds. Strong
actions and reactions take place in social life, but not
orderly growth and gain. The first impression no doubt is
that of noble zeal and self-sacrifice, but this is not the sort
of work by which society gains. The progress of society
is nothing but the slow and far remote result of steady,
laborious, painstaking growth of individuals. The man
who makes the most of himself and does his best in his
sphere is doing far more for the public good than the philanthropist
who runs about with a scheme which would set
the world straight if only everybody would adopt it.</p>

<p>This view cuts down a great deal of the heroism which
fills such a large part of our poetry, but it brings us, I
think, several very encouraging reflections. The first is
that one does not need to be a hero to be of some importance
in the world. Heroes are gone by. We want now a
good supply of efficient workaday men, to stand each in
his place and do good work. The second reflection to which
we are led is that we do not need to be straining our eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
continually to the horizon to see where we are coming out,
or, in other words, we do not need to trouble ourselves
with grand theories and purposes. The determination to
do just what lies next before us is enough. The great results
will all come of themselves and take care of themselves.
We may spare ourselves all grand emotions and
heroics, because the more simply and directly we take the
business of life, the better will be the result. The third
inference which seems to be worth mentioning is that we
come to understand the value of trifles.</p>

<p>All that I have said here about wisdom, fame, glory,
“public good,” as ends to be aimed at, holds good also of
culture. It becomes a sham and affectation when we make
it an immediate end, and comes in its true form only as a
remote and refined result of long labor and discipline.</p>

<p>Before I speak of it, however, in its direct relation to
education, let me introduce one other observation on the
doctrine I have stated that we cannot aim at the great
results directly. That is this: the motive to all immediate
efforts is either self-interest or the desire to gratify
one’s tastes and natural tendencies. I say that all the
grand results which make up what we call social progress
are the results of millions of efforts on the part of millions
of people, and that the motive to each effort in the heart
of the man who made it was the gratification of a need or
a tendency of his nature. I know that some may consider
this a selfish doctrine, eliminating all self-sacrifice and
martyr or missionary spirit, but to me it is a pleasure to
observe that we are not at war with ourselves, and that
the intelligent pursuit of our best good as individuals is
the surest means to the good of society. Moreover, do
you imagine that if you set out to make the most of yourself
in any position in which you are placed, that you will
have no chance for self-sacrifice, and no opportunity of
martyrdom offered you? Do you think that a man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
employs thoroughly all the means he possesses to make his
one unit of humanity as perfect as possible, can do so without
at every moment giving and receiving with the other
units about him? Do you think that he can go on far
without finding himself stopped by the question whether
his comrades are going in the same direction or not? Will
he not certainly find himself forced to stand against a tide
which is flowing in the other direction? It will certainly
be so. The real martyrs have always been the men who
were forced to go one way while the rest of the community
in which they lived were going another, and they were
swept down by the tide. I promise you that if you pursue
what is good for yourself, you need not take care for the
good of society; I warn you that if you pursue what is
good, you will find yourself limited by the stupidity, ignorance,
and folly of the society in which you live; and I
promise you also that if you hold on your way through the
crowd or try to make them go with you, you will have
ample experience of self-sacrifice and as much martyrdom
as you care for.</p>

<p>Now, if I have not led you too deep into social philosophy,
let us turn again to culture. We find that culture
comes from thought, study, observation, literary and scientific
activity, and we find that men practice these for gain,
for professional success, for immediate pleasure, or to
gratify their tastes. The great motive of interest provides
the energy and this culture is but a secondary result. It
is a significant fact to observe that when the motive of
interest is removed, culture becomes flaccid and falls into
dilletantism.</p>

<p>I think that we have gained a standpoint now from
which we can study undergraduate life and make observations
on it which have even scientific value. During an
undergraduate career, the motive of interest in each successive
step is wanting. There is no immediate object of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
pleasure or gain in the lesson to be learned next. Only
exceptionally is it true that the learning of the lesson will
gratify a taste or fill a desire. The university honors are
only artificial means of arousing the same great motive,
which is in the social body what gravitation is in physics.
The penalties which are here to be dreaded are but imitations
of life’s penalties. I think that many who have
undertaken to give advice and rebuke and warning to
young men in a state of pupilage have failed because they
have not fully analyzed or correctly grasped this fact, that
the academical world is a little community by itself in
which the great natural forces which bind older men to
sobriety and wisdom act only imperfectly. Life is far less
interesting when the successive steps are taken under compulsion
or for a good which is remote and only known by
hearsay, than it is when every step is taken for an immediate
profit. I doubt very much whether the hope of culture
or self-sacrificing zeal for the public good would make
older men toil in lawyer’s offices and counting-houses,
unless there were such immediate rewards as wealth and
professional success. In real life it is true that men must
do very many things which are disagreeable and which
they do not want to do, but there too the disagreeable
things are made easier to bear. The troubles of academical
life seem to be arbitrary troubles, inflicted by device of
foolish or malicious men. Troubles of that kind always
rouse men to anger and rankle in their hearts. But there
is no railing against those ills of life which are inherent in
the constitution of things. A man who rails at those is
laughed at. So the man just emancipated from academical
life finds himself freed from conventional rules but subjected
to penalties for idleness and extravagance and folly
infinitely heavier than any he has been accustomed to, and
inflicted without warning or mercy or respite. On the other
hand, he finds that life presents opportunities and attractions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
for him to work, where work has a zest about it which
comes from contact with living things. His academical
weapons and armor are stiff and awkward at first and he
may very probably come to despise them, but longer experience
will show that his education, if it was good, gave
him rather the power to use any weapons than special skill
in the use of particular ones. Special technical skill always
tends to routine. Although it is an advantage in itself, it
may under circumstances become a limitation. The only
true conception of a “liberal” education is that it gives a
broad discipline to the whole man, which uses routine
without being conquered by it and can change its direction
and application when occasion requires.</p>

<p>This brings me then to speak of the real scope and advantage
of a disciplinary education. A man who has enjoyed
such an education has simply had his natural powers
developed and reduced to rule, and he has gained for himself
an intelligent control of them. Before an academical
audience it is not necessary for me to stop to clear away
the popular notions about untutored powers and self-made
men. It is enough to say that the “self-made” man is,
by the definition, the first bungling essay of a bad workman.
An undeveloped human mind is simply a bundle of
possibilities. It may come to much or little. If it is highly
trained by years of patient exercise, judiciously imposed, it
becomes capable of strict and methodical action. It may
be turned to any one of a hundred tasks which offer themselves
to us men here on earth. It may have gained this
discipline in one particular science or another, and it may
have special technical acquaintance with one more than
another. Such will almost surely be the case, but there is
not a more mistaken, one-sided, and mischievous controversy
than that about <em>the</em> science which should be made
the basis of education. Every science has, for disciplinary
purposes, its advantages and its limitations. The man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
is trained on chemistry will become a strict analyst and
will break up heterogeneous compounds of all kinds, but
he will be likely also to rest content with this destructive
work and to leave the positive work of construction or
synthesis to others. The man who is trained on history will
be quick to discern continuity of force or law under different
phases, but he will be content with broad phases and
heterogeneous combinations such as history offers, and will
not be a strict analyst. The man who is trained on mathematics
will have great power of grasping purely conceptional
relations, or abstract ideas, which are, however,
most sharply defined; but he will be likely to fasten upon
a subordinate factor in some other kind of problem, especially
if that factor admits of more complete abstraction
than any of the others. The man who is trained on the
science of language approaches the continuity and development
of history with a guiding thread in his hand, and his
comparisons, furnishing stepping-stones now on the right
and now on the left, lead him on in a course where induction
and deduction go so close together that they can
hardly be separated; but the study of language again
always threatens to degenerate into a cram of grammatical
niceties and a fastidiousness about expression, under
which the contents are forgotten. Now, in individual
affairs, family, social, and political affairs, all these powers
of mind find occasion for exercise. They are needed in
business, in professions, in technical pursuits; and the
man best fitted for the demands of life would be the man
whose powers of mind of all these diverse orders and kinds
had all been harmoniously developed. How shallow then
is the idea that education is meant to give or can give a
mass of monopolized information, and how important it
is that the student should understand what he may expect
and what he may not expect from his education. As your
education goes on, you ought to gain in your power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
observation. Natural incidents, political occurrences, social
events, ought to present to you new illustrations of general
principles with which your studies have made you familiar.
You ought to gain in power to analyze and compare, so
that all the fallacies which consist in presenting things as
like, which are not like, should not be able to befog your
reason. You ought to become able to recognize and test a
generalization, and to distinguish between true generalizations
and dogmas on the one hand, or commonplaces on
another, or whimsical speculations on another. You ought
to know when you are dealing with a true law which you
may follow to the uttermost; when you have only a general
truth; when you have an hypothetical theory; when you
have a possible conjecture; and when you have only an
ingenious assumption. These are most important distinctions
on either side. Some people are affected by a notion,
fashionable just now, that it belongs to culture never to
go too far. Mr. Brook, in “Middlemarch,” you remember,
is a type of that culture. He believed in things up to a
certain point and was always afraid of going too far. We
have a good many aspirants after culture nowadays whose
capital consists in a superficial literary tradition and the
same kind of terror of going too far. They would put a
saving clause in the multiplication table, and make reservations
in the rule of three. On the other hand, we have
those who can never express anything to which they are
inclined to assent without gushing. A simple opinion
must be set forth in a torrent fit to enforce a great scientific
truth. One is just as much the sign of an imperfect
training as the other, and you meet with both, as my description
shows, in persons who pride themselves on their
culture. I will not deny that they are cultivated; I only
say that they are not well disciplined, that is, not well
educated.</p>

<p>Your education, if it is disciplinary, ought also to teach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
you the value of clear thinking, that is, of exact definitions,
clear propositions, well-considered opinions. What a flood
of loose rhetoric, distorted fact, and unclear thinking is
poured out upon us whenever a difficult question falls into
popular discussion! You cannot find that people who
assume to take part in the discussion have a clear definition
in their minds of even what they conceive the main
terms in the discussion to mean. They do not seem able
to make a proposition which will bear handling so as to
see what it is, and whether it is true or not. They cannot
analyze even such facts as they have collected, and hence
cannot draw inferences which are sound. It needs but
little discussion of any great political or social question to
show instances of this, and to show the immense importance
of having in the community men of trained and disciplined
intellects, who can think with some clearness and
resist plain confusion of terms and thought. For instance,
I saw the other day a long argument on an important
public topic which turned upon the assertion and belief
on the part of the writer that a mathematical ratio and a
subjective opinion were things of the same nature and
value. Perhaps, when he was at school, his father thought
there was no use in studying algebra and geometry. It
would not make so much difference if he would not now
meddle with things for which he did not prepare himself,
but it is this kind of person who is the pest of every science,
traversing it with his whims and speculations; and perhaps
I feel the more strongly the importance of this point because
the political, economic, and social sciences suffer
from the want of high discipline more than any others.</p>

<p>I ought not to pass without mention here the mischief
which is done in every science by its undisciplined advocates
who, while admitted to its inner circle, distract its
progress and throw it into confusion by neglect of strict
principles, by incorrect analyses or classifications, or by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
flinching in the face of fallacies. They render the ranks
unsteady and delay the march, and the reason is because
they have never had rigorous discipline either before or
since they enlisted.</p>

<p>If your education is disciplinary, it ought also to teach
you how to organize. I add this point especially because
I esteem it important and it is rarely noticed. It is really
a high grade of discipline which enables men to organize
voluntarily. If men begin to study and think, they move
away from tradition and authority. The first effect is to
break up and dissolve their inherited and traditional opinions
as to religion, politics, and society. This is a necessary
process of transition from formal and traditional dogma
to intelligent conviction. It applies to all the notions of
religion, as has often been noticed, but it applies none the
less to politics and to one’s notions of life. The commonplaces
of patriotism, the watchwords of parties and tradition,
the glib and well-worn phrases and terms have to be
analyzed again, and under the process much of their dignity
and sanctity evaporates. So too one’s views of life, of the
meaning of social phenomena, and of the general rules for
men to pursue with each other, undergo a recasting. Now
during this process, men diverge and break up. They do
not agree. They differ by less and more, and also by the
various recombinations of the factors which they make.
Pride, vanity, and self-seeking come in to increase this
divergence, it being regarded as a sign of independence
of thought.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that so long as this divergence
exists, it is a sign of a low and imperfect development of
science. If pride and vanity intermingle, they show that
discipline has not yet done its perfect work. It is only on
a higher stage of culture or discipline that self is so overborne
in zeal for the scientific good that opinions converge
and organization becomes possible. But you are well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
aware that without organization we men can accomplish
very little. It is not the freedom of the barbarian who
would rather live alone than undergo the inevitable coercion
of the neighborhood of others that we want. We
want only free and voluntary coördination, but it belongs
to discipline itself to teach us that we must have coördination
in order to attain to any high form of good.</p>

<p>I have now tried to show you the scope, advantages, and
needs of a disciplinary education. I have one remark more
to make in this connection. A man with a well-disciplined
mind possesses a tool which he can use for any purpose
which he needs to serve. I do not consider it an important
question by the study of what sciences he shall get this discipline,
for, if he gets it, the acquisition of information in
any new department of learning will be easy for him, and
he will be strong, alert, and well equipped for any exigency
of life.</p>

<p>Before quitting the subject, I desire to point out its relation
to one other matter, that is, to morals, or manners.
It is a common opinion that the higher man attains, the
freer he becomes. A moment’s reflection will show that
this is not true—but rather quite the contrary. The
rowdy has far less restraints to consider than the gentleman.
“Noblesse oblige” was perverted in its application,
perhaps, before the Revolution, but it contains a sound
principle and a great truth. The higher you go in social
attainments, the greater will be the restraints upon you.
The gait, the voice, the manner, the rough independence,
of one order of men is unbecoming in another. Education
above all brings this responsibility. Discipline in manners
and morals does not belong to the specific matter of education,
but it follows of itself on true education. The educated
man must work by himself without any overseer over him.
He finds his compulsion in himself and it holds him to his
task longer and closer than any external compulsion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span></p>

<p>This responsibility to self we call honor, and it is one
of the highest fruits of discipline when discipline, having
wrought through intellect, has reached character. Honor
falls under the rule which I mentioned early in this lecture.
You cannot reach it because you want it. You cannot
reach it by direct effort. It cannot be taught to you as a
literary theory. True honor can only grow in men by the
long practice of conduct which is good and noble under
motives which are pure. We laugh at the artificial honor
of the Middle Ages and despise that of the dueling code,
but let us not throw away the kernel with the shell. Honor
is a tribunal within one’s self whose code is simply the best
truth one knows. There are no advocates, no witnesses,
and no technicalities. To feel one’s self condemned by
that tribunal is to feel at discord with one’s self and to sustain
a wound which rankles longer and stings more deeply
than any wound in the body. It is the highest achievement
of educational discipline to produce this sense of honor in
minds of young men, which gives them a guide in the midst
of temptation and at a time when all codes and standards
seem to be matter of opinion. I have said some things
about lack of discipline in thought and discussion, but
that is nothing compared with the lack of discipline in
conduct which you see in a man who has never known
what honor is, whose whole moral constitution is so formless
and flabby that it can perform none of its functions,
and who is continually seeking some special plea, or sophistry,
or deceptive device for paying homage to the right
while he does the wrong. Education ought to act against
all this and in favor of a high code of honor, not simply
the education of schools and academies, but that together
with the education of home and family. Our great educational
institutions ought to have an atmosphere of their
own and impose traditions of their own, for the power which
controls in the academic community is not the voice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
authority but the voice of academic public opinion. That
might root out falsehood and violence and meanness of
every kind, which no penalties of those in authority could
ever reach; and I submit that such a public opinion would
be becoming in a body of young men of good home advantages
and the best educational opportunities the country
affords. Call it high training, or culture, or discipline, or
high breeding, or what you will, it is only the sense of
what we owe to ourselves, and it is greater and greater
according to our opportunities.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Note by the Editor</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Among</span> Professor Sumner’s papers there turned up
a curiosity which I do not like to pass over altogether,
although it is more appropriate, perhaps, to the purposes
of the biographer. Apparently Sumner amused himself,
along in the seventies or early eighties, in figuring to himself
the state of the world under a socialistic régime of the
sort which he was always ridiculing and opposing. He did
this by imagining the contents of a socialist newspaper,
the <i>New Era</i>, of the date July 4, 1950, consisting of editorials,
news notes, public announcements, criminal cases, and
even a book review. The whole caricatures in high
colors the phenomena attending such a régime in its
period of exuberance. “The following,” he writes, “is a
complete and verbatim copy of a [New York City] newspaper
of the date given. It is printed on a small quarter
sheet of coarse paper. The printing is so bad that it is
hard to read, and the typographical errors, all of which
have been corrected, are inexcusable.”</p>

<p>The motto of the paper is: “Let the Rich Pay! Let
the Poor Enjoy!” The responsible editor is Lasalle Smith,
and the proprietors Marx Jones, Chairman of the New
York City Board of Ethical Control, Cabet Johnson, Chairman
of the Board of Arbitration for Wages and Prices,
Babœuf Brown, Chairman of the Board of Control for
Rents and Loans, and Rousseau Peters, President of the
Coöperative Bank. A notice warns readers that “This
paper is published strictly under the coöperative rules<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
established by the Typographical Union in our office and
under the direction of the council of the same. The Committee
of Grievances gives its assent and approval to
each number before it is published. All subscriptions are
payable monthly in advance to the Treasurer of the Typographical
Union. The Typographical Union, being a member
of the organized Coöperative Commonwealth, has police
powers for the collection of all sums due to it.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>A special notice reads as follows:</p>

<p>We send copies of this edition of our paper to a large
number of persons who have not hitherto coöperated in our
enterprise but whom we have enrolled until they signify
their refusal. We call especial attention to the names and
standing in the Coöperative Commonwealth of the proprietors
of this journal. We believe that many of those
whom we now invite to coöperate, and who have been under
suspicion of being monopolists, capitalists, recalcitrants, and
reactionists, will see that they cannot better establish their
credit for civism than by accepting our invitation.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The following extracts are from the editorials:</p>

<p>Our reports of the Ethical Tribunal show that our noble
Board of Ethical Control needs to guard diligently our
interests. Another pestilent preacher has been condemned
to the chain gang. At least we make sure that our streets
will be cleaned, a task which no coöperators could be asked
to perform, since all the ancient lawyers, professors, and
preachers are now condemned to this business. The
stubbornness and incorrigibility of these classes towards the
Commonwealth is astonishing.</p>

<p class="minortb">The Board of Ethical Control announce as the result of
the plébiscite which was taken on April 1 last, that, by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
vote of 5319 to 782, the Commonwealth voted to retain the
present Board of Ethical Control for ten years, instead of
reëlecting them annually as heretofore. This is as it
should be. Why disturb the tranquillity of our happy
state by constant elections when our affairs are entrusted
to such competent hands?</p>

<p class="minortb">The agents of the Board of Ethical Control reported 213
persons found dead in the streets at the dawn of day, 174
bearing marks of violence; the rest, not having coöperators’
tickets, were ancient monopolists who had apparently
perished of want. The Grand Coöperator said that he
should submit to the Board of Ethical Control the question
whether it is edifying to continue these reports.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>There follow extracts from the inaugural of G. P. M. C.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
Lasalle Brown, which begin with the sentiment:</p>

<p><em>Of old ye were enslaved by those who said: Work! Save!
Study! We emancipate you by saying: Enjoy! Enjoy!
Enjoy!</em></p>

<p>The first right of everyone born on this earth is the
right to enjoy. The Coöperative Commonwealth assures
this right to all its members.</p>

<p>We have not abolished private property. We only
hold that every man is considered to have devoted his
property to public use. We have not abolished landlords,
capitalists, employers, or captains of industry. We retain
and use them. Such members of a society are useful and
necessary if only they be held firmly in check and forced
to contribute to the public good.</p>

<p>We need “history” and “statistics” to batter down
all the old system, but we should be the dupes of our own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
processes if we used them against ourselves. All sensible
coöperators should know that history and statistics are
far greater swindles than science.</p>

<p>There are dangers in the Coöperative Commonwealth
which demand vigilance. There is danger of jealousy and
division amongst coöperators. Harmony is essential to the
Coöperative Commonwealth and we must have it at any
price.</p>

<p>Some say that our Commonwealth is weak. It is the
strongest state that ever existed. No one before our time
ever knew the power of a “mob,” as it used to be called.
At a tap of the bell, every coöperator is at hand. Our only
danger is factious division of this power. Let every coöperator
have rewards for harmony and penalties for faction—strict,
sure, and heavy!</p>

<p>There is danger from science. The evolution heresy is
a worse foe to coöperation than the old Christian dogma.
Stamp it out!</p>

<p>There is danger from the virus of the old anarchism—worst
of all because it is often enough like the truth to
deceive the elect. It means liberty and individualism.
Stamp it out!</p>

<p>Under the heading “Domestic News” occurs the
following:</p>

<p>The Commissioners of Emigration have detected several
persons striving to leave the city for Long Island, carrying
gold with them. It is well known that many rich persons,
animated by selfishness and disregarding their duties as
trustees of their wealth for the public, have escaped to the
wilds of Long Island beyond the Commune of Brooklyn,
carrying with them all the gold which they could obtain.
Hence the Commissioners of Emigration have arranged to
patrol the East River by the Commonwealth galleys and
have limited the ferry transits to the Fulton ferry between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
8 and 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and 5 and 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Any persons found
carrying away gold will be sent to the galleys and the
gold confiscated. Gold is needed to buy supplies for the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p class="minortb">No dispatches from Philadelphia have been received for
a fortnight. A steamboat of 100 tons burden is cruising in
the Hudson River, taking toll of all goods in transit across
the river. Reports disagree as to the character of the
persons on this boat. By some it is asserted to be manned
by coöperators who, being poor, are putting into effect ethical
claims against material goods. By others it is said to
be manned by a gang of monopolist scoundrels and vagabonds,
who, driven to desperation by the boycott and plan
of campaign, seek this means to perpetuate their existence.
It behooves the Board of Ethical Control to learn which
of these reports is correct before taking action.</p>

<p class="minortb">A report comes from the West that the Indians have
seized Illinois, killing the whites and taking possession of
the improvements. They have imbibed the ancient capitalistic
notions and are impervious to ethical and coöperative
doctrines. They are rapidly increasing in numbers,
strange as it may seem, for we have read in ancient books
that they were dying out a century ago. It is suggested
that they now increase because they are conquering,
and that they will go on doing so until they exterminate
all whites from the continent. In the absence of private
mails, we humbly suggest that our Board of Ethical Control
should communicate with similar boards of the
communes to the westward.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Under the heading “Industrial”:</p>

<p>The Board of Equalization of Production have set the
amounts of various commodities which may be produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
during the coming fall season. Those whom it concerns
are to call at the office of the Board at once, pay the fees,
and obtain their instructions. The penalty of over-production
is fixed at 100 coöperative units per unit of product,
half to the informer.</p>

<p class="minortb">The Board of Arbitration for Contracts will sit daily at
their office in Coöperative Hall from 10 to 12 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to approve
of contracts. The fee is 1000 coöperative units from
each party. Notice is called to the ordinance of the Board
of Ethical Control: “If two or more persons make a contract
without the presence and approval of the Board of
Arbitration or otherwise than in conformity with the
regulations of said Board, they may be fined according to
the circumstances of the case.”</p>

<p class="minortb">The Coöperative Railroad Commission, having found a
mechanic to repair the locomotive, announce that they
will recommence regular weekly trips to Yonkers on next
Monday. A train will start at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, or as soon thereafter
as convenient. Accommodation for twenty-five passengers.
Passports may be obtained until noon on Saturday. They
must be viséd by the Railroad Commission and by the
Coöperative Guardians of Public Morals at their office in
the Coöperative Workhouse not later than two o’clock on
the same time. The fare to Yonkers will be 10,000 coöperative
units. On account of the inter-county commerce law,
all freight and passengers will be trans-shipped at Yonkers.
To prevent vexatious inquiries, the Commission hereby
announce that they are not informed whether or when
trains will be dispatched to points beyond.</p>

<p class="minortb">Since the Commonwealth was founded, as our readers
know, coöperators have refused to work in coal mines. No
great harm has come of this since the factories and machinery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
have been abolished and railroads and steamers
have almost gone out of use. Some coal, however, is a
convenience, and our readers will see with pleasure that
delinquents in considerable numbers are being sent to
these mines under an agreement with our Board of Ethical
Control with the similar authority of the Lehigh Commune
in the ancient state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>We are informed that a number of ancient capitalists and
monopolists, being in a starving condition, recently applied
to the Board of the said Commune for leave to go into an
abandoned coal mine and work it for their own support.</p>

<p class="minortb">A week ago yesterday, Coöperative Association 2391,
A. P. D., bricklayers, 7824, M. X. H., plasterers, 4823
N. K. J., hodcarriers, F. L. M. 8296, joiners, met to consider
the state of the building trades. On account of the
decrease in the population, by which great numbers of
houses are vacant, building has ceased for years past and
these once great associations have dwindled down. The
Board of Ethical Control has caused public buildings to
be constructed in order to give them work and has ordered
landlords to make repairs to the same end. The conference
on Friday, a week ago, was to consider further measures
of relief. It was decided that no vacant house ought
to be allowed to stand. Some maintained that no repairs
ought to be allowed at all, in order that new houses might
become necessary, but others thought that this would take
away what little work is now obtained. G. C. Marx Rogers,
former professor of political economy, made a speech
in which he proposed that all houses now vacant and all
ruins now standing which give shelter to unregistered vagabonds
and boycotted persons should be destroyed; also
that a committee be appointed to inspect all existing dwellings,
mark those which are out of repair and unfit for coöperative
residences, and that these latter should then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
be razed to the ground. This would cause an immediate
demand for new houses. This proposition was unanimously
adopted.</p>

<p>On Wednesday last the coöperative associations aforesaid
met to hear the report of the committee. Twelve
hundred and forty-seven houses had been noted so far as
unfit for residences. The joint associations passed a decree
against said houses, as a beginning, and ordered the committee
of the whole to proceed to execute it.</p>

<p>They marched in a body to Bleecker Street, the northernmost
limit of the ruined houses and demolished them entirely.
They then moved southerly, destroying all vacant
houses. Gradually, a number of persons gathered to look
on. The agents of Ethical Supervision kept this crowd at
a distance and secured the joint Coöperative Associations
full independence in the execution of their decree.</p>

<p>In East Canal Street, Nonconformist Jonathan Merritt,
lessee of a block of tenements, tried to dissuade or prevent
the destruction of his buildings. He was roughly handled,
his skull split open and his arm broken by the coöperators.
The agents of Ethical Supervision took him in on a charge
of disturbing the public peace.</p>

<p>When it came to the destruction of occupied buildings,
the tenants objected. By the ordinance of the Board of
Lodgings and Rents, each had been allotted to his domicile
and was, of course, bound to keep it until allowed to
change. It was also feared that no lodgings could be found.
The Board of Lodgings and Rents immediately convened
and issued new allotments of domicile. Suspects, nonconformists,
recalcitrants, and reactionists were sent to lodge
in the ancient churches and the coöperators were assigned
to their tenements.</p>

<p>The revival and prosperity of the building trades is now
assured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span></p>

<p>Under the heading “Misdemeanors”:</p>

<p>Of all forms of incivism, the most reprehensible is hoarding
gold. All good coöperators who know of cases of this
criminal selfishness are bound to report it at the Bureau of
Ethical Supervision under penalty of incivism on the one
hand and a reward of ten per cent of the sum on the other.
All gold must be exchanged at the bank of G. C. Cabet
Rogers for coöperative units.</p>

<p class="minortb">An audacious lampoon has been printed at some secret
press, the authors of which must be discovered at all cost.
It is a blasphemous parody of the Coöperative Catechism.
The Commission of Ethical Inquiry has directed all its
powerful machinery to detect the authors of this outrage.
Let every coöperator appoint himself a detective to help.
Search every house in your neighborhood! Trust nobody!
Every person found in possession of a copy of this pamphlet
will be summarily removed from the Commonwealth.</p>

<p class="minortb">The supply of potatoes which forms the staple food of
the mass of our population is obtained from the northern
part of the commune, in what was formerly Westchester
County. The great fields there are tilled by the delinquents
under taxes and fines, incorrigible monopolists, survival
capitalists and others under judicial sentence, under
the direction of the Board of Ethical Control. The convicts
work from sunrise to sunset, in order to mark the distinction
between them and honorable coöperators, who
work but five hours per day. The product of the fields on
its way to the town is subjected to toll by the free coöperative
associations of the suburbs. Hence it always
threatens to be inadequate. Good coöperators cannot
better serve the Commonwealth than by ferreting out
violators of the ordinances and other persons guilty of
incivism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span></p>

<p class="minortb">Karl Marx Jones, agent of the Board of Equalization of
Distribution, has disappeared. It is thought that he has
gone towards Boston. He reported to the Board, it will
be remembered, two weeks ago, a case of hoarding of gold.
He was sent to collect it and was made custodian of it.
It has disappeared. The Board count upon the aid of
communes to the eastward to recover the gold, but not
very confidently. He left all his coöperative units behind
him.</p>

<p>Boycotts are declared against Robert Dorr, for saying
that the Coöperative Commonwealth is only a scheme to
let a few exploit all the rest; Matthew Brown, for saying
that it is all a woman’s honor is worth to appear on the
street of the Coöperative Commonwealth, even thickly
veiled, for she runs the risk of attracting the attention of
someone against whom no one can defend her; James
Rowe, for refusing to aid the agents of the society in taking
from her home without public scandal a woman charged
with incivism; John White, for hiding gold coin; William
Peck, for saying that Grand Coöperator Lasalle Brown
secured the boycott of Elihu Snow to get his property away
from him; Edward Grant, for saying that the Coöperative
Commonwealth is only slavery in disguise and the treatment
of persons convicted of incivism is slavery without
disguise; Peter Moon, for saying that the Plan of Campaign
is only a scheme to allow a man’s debtors to rob
him of a small fraction of their debts if they will let some
of the Grand Coöperators rob him of all the remainder.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>A considerable number of minor offences are tried before
Grand Coöperator Rodbertus Pease, Member of the Board
of Ethical Control:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span></p>

<p>George Wood, aged sixty, was arraigned for carrying a
pistol at night, not being a member of any coöperative
club and therefore not entitled so to do. He declared that
the streets were unsafe at night and that he never went out
after dark if he could help it, but that he was compelled
to go for a doctor for his sick grandchild and took the pistol
for security. He was met by two coöperators who asked
him to contribute to the Aged Coöperators’ Retreat. On
his declaring that he had nothing, they searched him and
found the pistol. They then demanded his coöperator’s
ticket. As he had none, they took him to the Bureau of
Ethical Supervision, where he was detained until morning.
The two complainants appeared against him. They declared
that they were poor men. On examination it appeared
that he was an incorrigible adherent of the ancient
monopolism. He was fined 10,000 coöperative units, half
to the informers. He began to lament at this, saying that
he was very poor—poorer than the complainants; but the
Grand Coöperator declared that no man could be a poor
man who was not a coöperator.</p>

<p>The Emigration Commissioners whose sole duty is to
prevent any immigrants from coming into our commune
put at the bar Fritz Meyer, charged with immigrating.
He pretended to be a sailor on the <i>Ferdinand Lasalle</i>, but
did not return on board of her before she sailed. In defence
he pleaded that he was left by accident. He was condemned
to serve on the yacht of the Board of Ethical Control
at the pleasure of said Board.</p>

<p>Ulysses Perkins and others, some of whom were coöperators
and some not, complained that their neighborhood was
annoyed by the Coöperative Brotherhood who hold their
evening festivals at Coöperative Hall. They declared that
there was shouting and singing and that windows were
broken in spite of the heavy shutters. Their complaint
was dismissed as an attempt to oppress organized labor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
and the coöperators amongst them were especially reprimanded.
The Grand Coöperator remarked that the
prejudice against beer which was manifested in ancient
prohibitory and license laws was not respected by the
ethical judgment of our time.</p>

<p>On Monday last, several persons appeared to complain
that the roads outside of the city are infested by robbers.
They were detained and the Board of Ethical Control sent
out delegates to inquire. They reported yesterday, when
the complainants were brought before the tribunal to hear
their report. They denied that there was any robbery,
since robbery means undue exaction of rent or of work for
wages. The word was used by the complainants in the
ancient capitalistic sense. The delegates found many
coöperators enjoying holiday in the fields and by the wayside.
Some of them were playful and resented the exclusive
manner of passers-by who did not engage in sport. They
asked for treats, and they had appointed a committee to
solicit funds for their games. Some bands of banished
monopolists were reported to be infesting the woods, living
by chance or by tilling some small fields which have
not been allotted to them, and plotting against the Commonwealth.
The Grand Coöperator said that such persons
would be promptly dealt with and dispatched a force
of guardians of Ethical Order against them. The complainants
were discharged with a reprimand for misrepresenting
the innocent enjoyment of the coöperators in the
suburb.</p>

<p>William Johnson, employer, was arraigned for contumacy.
The Board of Arbitration ordered him to pay 1000 coöperative
units per day of six hours. He closed his works. The
Grand Coöperator ordered a second charge for malicious
lockout and fined him 10,000 coöperative units per day
until he should reopen his works.</p>

<p>“Foreign News” reports the following débâcle:</p>

<p>It will be remembered that about three years ago the
last remnant of English landlords was exiled to Guiana.
The Commune of London granted them a ship, of which
an immense number blocked the Thames, not having occupation,
and they were allowed to navigate it if they could.
Their children were taken away from them, to be educated
in the principles of coöperation. From this mistaken complaisance
a series of evil consequences have flowed.</p>

<p>Some of the exiles have had yachting experience and most
of them, being trained in the ancient athletic sports, were
able to navigate the ship. Instead of obeying the law,
they sailed to Gibraltar and captured the ancient fortress.
There they obtained arms and cannons, of which they put
a number on board their ship and returned to London.
Their first step was to seize the <i>Columbus</i>, a fine steamer of
1000 tons burden, one of the newest and in best repair of
those lying in the river. They then filled her bunkers with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
coal and wood which they took by force from the Commonwealth
barges in the river. They next seized the arsenals
at Greenwich and Norwich, carried off a great number of
repeating rifles and ammunition, and destroyed all the rest.
The coöperators of London, being taken unawares and
being prepared only to cope with the city monopolists, who
had been disarmed, were unable to interfere.</p>

<p>The pirates moored their vessel opposite the city and
sent a message of the G. P. M. C. by a captured coöperator
that they would bombard the city if their children
were not all delivered to them. A hundred of them landed
with repeating rifles and revolvers and marched to the
coöperative factories, where they set free all who chose
to join them. In short, they departed after securing their
children, a vast quantity of tools and machinery, arms,
supplies, and ammunition. A large number of flunkies
and snobs joined them, sufficient to man one or two other
vessels.</p>

<p>It now appears that they have taken possession of the
Island of Sicily and made it a base of concentration for a
grand political reaction. They have proclaimed as far as
possible that their island is a refuge for landlords, monopolists,
and capitalists, and the roads of Europe are crowded
with vagabonds seeking to reach this nest of pirates. The
pirate state is growing. It is a republic like one of our
ancient states. It has an army of 5000 men who boast that
with the arms which they possess they can march from one
end of Europe to another. They control the Mediterranean
and all its coasts. They have served notice on the communal
commonwealths of the Continent that they will
avenge any coercion exercised against any persons who
seek to join them, and six months ago they sent a force
of 6000 men to Lyons to set free a band of aristocrats who
were imprisoned there and were threatened with the
guillotine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span></p>

<p>It is said that there are no artisans now who are able
to manufacture repeating rifles like those which these
robbers possess, except amongst themselves—they having
hired mechanics to recover the art. Even the guns yet
remaining on the Continent cannot be used because the
art of making the ammunition is lost. It was a great mistake
to let these pestilent scoundrels loose. Their state
threatens the whole coöperative movement. Its existence
has greatly strengthened the collectivists among coöperators,
for it is said that the big empires must be restored (on
coöperative principles) to cope with them.</p>

<p>“Personal Items” record the following:</p>

<p>G. P. M. C. Lasalle Brown last evening gave a grand ball
and house-warming in his new house on Fifth Avenue.
By demolishing and removing the unsightly ruined houses
in the neighborhood, a beautiful park and garden have
been added to this fine tenement. It was illuminated last
evening by thousands of lamps and torches carried by the
convicts who are under discipline in the household of the
G. P. M. C. The guests were members of the Board of
Ethical Control and their families, some of whom, remembering
their own antecedents, observed with interest
amongst the convicts sons and daughters of ancient monopolists,
and in some cases white-haired survivals from the age
of bankers, railroad kings, and merchant princes. Such
are the revenges of history!</p>

<p class="minortb">One hundred new carriages for the Board of Ethical Control
have just arrived. They are of the most superb workmanship
and cost $5000 in gold each. They belong, of
course, to the Commonwealth and can only be used under
permission of the Board of Ethical Control. They have
been put, one each, under the care of separate members of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
the Board, as no private individual is allowed to violate
equality by owning a carriage. We noticed with pleasure
yesterday the families of Grand Coöperators in these carriages
in the park.</p>

<p>Non-conformists and others like them outside the pale of
the Commonwealth have, of late years, when they found
their position disagreeable, adopted the plan of attaching
themselves voluntarily as retainers or vassals to coöperators,
especially to the leading members of the Board of
Ethical Control. In this way they secure some of the
advantages of coöperation. In order to show their position
and relationship, they wear special tokens or marks.
The clients of the newly inaugurated G. P. M. C. have
just been put into uniform or livery. They attended him
in a body on his recent visit to his country seat at Riverdale,
where they did guard duty. Added to his personal
bodyguard of coöperators and friends, they made an imposing
body. This country-seat, by the way, has just been
surrounded by a high stone wall.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>There occurs an obituary of one of the community’s
leading lights:</p>

<p>G. C. Brissot Cunningham died at 01 Fifth Avenue on
Wednesday last. He was born May 16, 1905 and was educated
for a lawyer. In 1930, putting himself in the foremost
rank of the coöperative movement and identifying
himself with the most radical section, he was admitted to
the bar. By the abolition of inheritance, he found himself,
on the death of his father in the following year, thrown
entirely on his own resources. He then passed through
some years of obscurity and great poverty, which taught
him to feel for the poor.</p>

<p>Allying himself with the noble band which supported
our present G. P. M. C., he helped to bring about the foundation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
of the coöperation in 1940 and was elected member
of the Board of Ethical Control. In the Board he filled
many of the most important and responsible positions on
the several committees and was regularly reëlected. He
devoted himself to securing the Commonwealth, flinching
from no measure to establish it. He believed thoroughly
in the motto “Enjoy.” After he became a member of the
Board of Ethical Control, the former mansion of the ——s
on Fifth Avenue was allotted to him and furnished from
the Commonwealth storehouse of forfeited property. He
there kept up a munificent hospitality on the most altruistic
principles. He neither cared to know whence his
income came nor whither it went. In the spirit of a true
coöperator, whatever belonged to the Commonwealth was
his and whatever was his was free to any coöperator. His
popularity with the masses was shown yesterday when they
turned out in a body for his funeral. The non-coöperators
who had felt his scourge were naturally absent. A few of
them who could not conceal their joy at his death were
summarily corrected by the coöperators. By his death at
the early age of forty-five, our Commonwealth has lost a
valuable supporter.</p>

<p>[According to the ordinance adopted by the Board of
Ethical Control, February 10, 1945, since he died a member
of the Board, his family will have a pension of $15,000
per annum in gold for twenty-five years and the use of his
house for the same time. The Board will fill the vacancy
next week.—Editor of this paper.]</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The <i>Text-book of Coöperation</i>, ordained by the Board of
Ethical Control for schools, is reviewed as follows:</p>

<p>This book is an authoritative exposition of the Coöperative
Commonwealth in the commune form. It is to supersede
all other books except the primer, writing-book, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
elementary arithmetic. We have done with all the ancient
rubbish. All the books which have not been destroyed are
under the control of the Board of Ethical Control. Especially
we are now rid of all pernicious trash about history,
law, and political economy. The present book
contains all that a good coöperator needs to know. Its
tone is strictly ethical. By separating all children of incorrigibles
and survivals from their parents and educating
them on this book, we may soon hope to bring all capitalistic
tradition to an end.</p>

<p>It is plainly proved here that the first right of every
man and woman is the right to capital. This right is valid
up to the time when he or she gets capital, when it becomes
ethically subject to the similar right of someone else, who
has no capital as yet, to have some. This principle carried
out is the guarantee of justice and equality and is the fundamental
principle of the Coöperative Commonwealth in
the middle of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The text-book describes the organization of our Commonwealth,
with the duties of coöperators, and gives a
list of the ordinances of the Board of Control.</p>

<p>There are now 1000 members of the Board of Ethical
Control and 10,000 agents in their employ, chosen by
lot monthly from all coöperators. The Board is divided
into ten Boards of 100 each for various branches of duty.
The members receive no salary but are remunerated by
fees. They enjoy no privileges or rights in the Commonwealth,
but have the duty of regulating all coöperative
affairs according to their conscientious convictions of justice.
The ten chairmen of Boards form an exclusive commission
which decrees boycotts and plans of campaign.
There are no laws or lawyers in the system and no courts
or juries of the ancient type, now happily almost forgotten.
There are no police, no detectives, no army, no militia, and
no prisons. The ancient prison at Sing Sing, which is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
within the limits of this commune, is turned into a Coöperators’
Retreat. Under this happy régime no coöperator
can do wrong. Our only culprits are recalcitrants, suspects,
incorrigibles, survivals, and other would-be perpetuators of
the old régime of monoply and capitalistic extortion. Such
persons are compelled to expiate their selfishness and incivism
by hard labor, but they are taken for this purpose
into the households or factories of the members of the
Board of Ethical Control, where they are subject to ethical
discipline and produce those things which are essential to
the community and which the Board of Ethical Control
contracts to provide. The employments are such as free
coöperators consider disagreeable, unhealthy, or degrading.</p>

<p>The Committee of Inquiry into Incivism is a committee
of the Board of Ethical Control and has the high and important
duty of watching over coöperative duties. Its
number and members are unknown, lest they should be
objects of malice. Its sessions and procedure are secret.
It employs 100 agents but has a right to command
the services at any time of all coöperators. Complaints
of incivism may be lodged night or day by any
coöperator in the lion’s mouth in the court of the Coöperative
Hall (ancient United States postoffice).</p>

<p>The Committee proceeds against persons guilty of incivism
by boycotts chiefly. This measure puts the culprit
outside the pale of the Commonwealth which he has
maligned or in which he has refused to take his share. Such
persons become vagabonds, and disappear or perish.</p>

<p>The chapter on coöperative religion is in the form of a
catechism and is to be thoroughly learned by heart by all
pupils. It inculcates the doctrines of our social creed by
which each one is bound to serve the health, wealth, and
happiness of every other. Those who have the means of
material enjoyment shall put them at the disposition and
use of those who have them not. It impresses above all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
great duty of civism, or conformity to coöperative organization
and obedience to the Board of Ethical Control.</p>

<p>There is complete equality and no distinction of class in
the Coöperative Commonwealth. Every man, woman, and
child is eligible to the Board of Ethical Control. The only
distinction is of merit and service to the Commonwealth.
In this the members of the Board of Ethical Control
stand first. There is no second. Outside of the Coöperative
Committee are, in order of demerit and detestation,
probationers (coöperators who have forfeited their coöperative
tickets for fault but who may be restored to membership),
survivals (employers, capitalists, landlords, usurers,
subject to the Commonwealth and continuing the ancient
functions of such persons), nonconformists (stubborn persons
who refuse to conform to the new order), recalcitrants
(any of the former who have been subject to discipline five
times), incorrigibles (after twenty cases of discipline), suspects
(so decreed if charged but not convicted of incivism),
reactionists (once coöperators but convicted of disorganization)
and convicts (under boycott or plan of campaign).
Every person must be registered and have always on his
person a brass medal hung by a chain about his neck,
bearing his designation and number, with the letters designating
his group, domicile, also district, ward, and arrondissement.
This constitutes his social designation. These
medals are given out by the Board of Ethical Supervision.
The fee is 1000 coöperative units, repeated each time that
the person is re-classified and a new medal issued.</p>

<p>The editor has no compunction about publishing these

most of historical or personal interest. Perhaps, in the
light of the antics of the Bolsheviki, even such a parody as
the foregoing may seem less wide of the potentialities of
the socialistic system. In any case, if modern socialism
has renounced some of the wild dreams of its past, that is
largely owing to the criticism and ridicule poured upon
them by vigorous opponents of the Sumner type. Says
a prominent American, writing to the editor subsequently
to the publication of one of the foregoing volumes of this
series: “I have for many years publicly and privately
urged socialists to read—<em>really</em> read—Sumner—as the
most doughty and competent foe with whom they have to
reckon.”

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I propose</span> in this lecture to discuss one of the most
subtile and widespread social fallacies. It consists in
the impression made on the mind for the time being by a
particular fact, or by the interests of a particular group of
persons, to which attention is directed while other facts or
the interests of other persons are entirely left out of account.
I shall give a number of instances and illustrations of this
in a moment, and I cannot expect you to understand what
is meant from an abstract statement until these illustrations
are before you, but just by way of a general illustration
I will put one or two cases.</p>

<p>Whenever a pestilence like yellow fever breaks out in
any city, our attention is especially attracted towards it,
and our sympathies are excited for the sufferers. If contributions
are called for, we readily respond. Yet the
number of persons who die prematurely from consumption
every year greatly exceeds the deaths from yellow fever
or any similar disease when it occurs, and the suffering
entailed by consumption is very much greater. The suffering
from consumption, however, never constitutes a
public question or a subject of social discussion. If an
inundation takes place anywhere, constituting a public
calamity (and an inundation takes place somewhere in
the civilized world nearly every year), public attention is
attracted and public appeals are made, but the losses by
great inundations must be insignificant compared with the
losses by runaway horses, which, taken separately, scarcely
obtain mention in a local newspaper. In hard times insolvent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
debtors are a large class. They constitute an
interest and are able to attract public attention, so that
social philosophers discuss their troubles and legislatures
plan measures of relief. Insolvent debtors, however, are
an insignificant body compared with the victims of commonplace
misfortune, or accident, who are isolated, scattered,
ungrouped and ungeneralized, and so are never made the
object of discussion or relief. In seasons of ordinary
prosperity, persons who become insolvent have to get out
of their troubles as they can. They have no hope of relief
from the legislature. The number of insolvents during a
series of years of general prosperity, and their losses, greatly
exceed the number and losses during a special period of
distress.</p>

<p>These illustrations bring out only one side of my subject,
and that only partially. It is when we come to
the proposed measures of relief for the evils which have
caught public attention that we reach the real subject
which deserves our attention. As soon as A observes something
which seems to him to be wrong, from which X is
suffering, A talks it over with B, and A and B then propose
to get a law passed to remedy the evil and help X. Their
law always proposes to determine what C shall do for X
or, in the better case, what A, B and C shall do for X. As
for A and B, who get a law to make themselves do for X
what they are willing to do for him, we have nothing to say
except that they might better have done it without any
law, but what I want to do is to look up C. I want to
show you what manner of man he is. I call him the
Forgotten Man. Perhaps the appellation is not strictly
correct. He is the man who never is thought of. He is
the victim of the reformer, social speculator and philanthropist,
and I hope to show you before I get through that
he deserves your notice both for his character and for the
many burdens which are laid upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span></p>

<p>No doubt one great reason for the phenomenon which I
bring to your attention is the passion for reflection and
generalization which marks our period. Since the printing
press has come into such wide use, we have all been encouraged
to philosophize about things in a way which was
unknown to our ancestors. They lived their lives out in
positive contact with actual cases as they arose. They
had little of this analysis, introspection, reflection and
speculation which have passed into a habit and almost
into a disease with us. Of all things which tempt to generalization
and to philosophizing, social topics stand foremost.
Each one of us gets some experience of social forces. Each
one has some chance for observation of social phenomena.
There is certainly no domain in which generalization is
easier. There is nothing about which people dogmatize
more freely. Even men of scientific training in some
department in which they would not tolerate dogmatism
at all will not hesitate to dogmatize in the most reckless
manner about social topics. The truth is, however, that
science, as yet, has won less control of social phenomena
than of any other class of phenomena. The most complex
and difficult subject which we now have to study is the
constitution of human society, the forces which operate in
it, and the laws by which they act, and we know less about
these things than about any others which demand our
attention. In such a state of things, over-hasty generalization
is sure to be extremely mischievous. You cannot take
up a magazine or newspaper without being struck by the
feverish interest with which social topics and problems are
discussed, and if you were a student of social science, you
would find in almost all these discussions evidence, not
only that the essential preparation for the discussion is
wanting, but that the disputants do not even know that
there is any preparation to be gained. Consequently we
are bewildered by contradictory dogmatizing. We find in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
all these discussions only the application of pet notions and
the clashing of contradictory “views.” Remedies are
confidently proposed for which there is no guarantee offered
except that the person who prescribes the remedy says that
he is sure it will work. We hear constantly of “reform,”
and the reformers turn out to be people who do not like
things as they are and wish that they could be made nicer.
We hear a great many exhortations to make progress from
people who do not know in what direction they want to go.
Consequently social reform is the most barren and tiresome
subject of discussion amongst us, except æsthetics.</p>

<p>I suppose that the first chemists seemed to be very hard-hearted
and unpoetical persons when they scouted the
glorious dream of the alchemists that there must be some
process for turning base metals into gold. I suppose that
the men who first said, in plain, cold assertion, there is no
fountain of eternal youth, seemed to be the most cruel and
cold-hearted adversaries of human happiness. I know that
the economists who say that if we could transmute lead
into gold, it would certainly do us no good and might do
great harm, are still regarded as unworthy of belief. Do
not the money articles of the newspapers yet ring with the
doctrine that we are getting rich when we give cotton and
wheat for gold rather than when we give cotton and wheat
for iron?</p>

<p>Let us put down now the cold, hard fact and look at it
just as it is. There is no device whatever to be invented
for securing happiness without industry, economy, and
virtue. We are yet in the empirical stage as regards all
our social devices. We have done something in science and
art in the domain of production, transportation and exchange.
But when you come to the laws of the social
order, we know very little about them. Our laws and
institutions by which we attempt to regulate our lives under
the laws of nature which control society are merely a series<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
of haphazard experiments. We come into collision with
the laws and are not intelligent enough to understand
wherein we are mistaken and how to correct our errors.
We persist in our experiments instead of patiently setting
about the study of the laws and facts in order to see where
we are wrong. Traditions and formulæ have a dominion
over us in legislation and social customs which we seem
unable to break or even to modify.</p>

<p>For my present purpose I ask your attention for a few
moments to the notion of liberty, because the Forgotten
Man would no longer be forgotten where there was true
liberty. You will say that you know what liberty is.
There is no term of more common or prouder use. None
is more current, as if it were quite beyond the need of
definition. Even as I write, however, I find in a leading
review a new definition of civil liberty. Civil liberty the
writer declares to be “the result of the restraint exercised
by the sovereign people on the more powerful individuals
and classes of the community, preventing them from availing
themselves of the excess of their power to the detriment of
the other classes.” You notice here the use of the words
“sovereign people” to designate a class of the population,
not the nation as a political and civil whole. Wherever
“people” is used in such a sense, there is always fallacy.
Furthermore, you will recognize in this definition a very
superficial and fallacious construction of English constitutional
history. The writer goes on to elaborate that
construction and he comes out at last with the conclusion
that “a government by the people can, in no case, become
a paternal government, since its law-makers are its mandataries
and servants carrying out its will, and not its fathers
or its masters.” This, then, is the point at which he
desires to arrive, and he has followed a familiar device in
setting up a definition to start with which would produce
the desired deduction at the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span></p>

<p>In the definition the word “people” was used for a
class or section of the population. It is now asserted
that if <em>that</em> section rules, there can be no paternal, that
is, undue, government. That doctrine, however, is the
very opposite of liberty and contains the most vicious
error possible in politics. The truth is that cupidity,
selfishness, envy, malice, lust, vindictiveness, are constant
vices of human nature. They are not confined to classes
or to nations or particular ages of the world. They present
themselves in the palace, in the parliament, in the
academy, in the church, in the workshop, and in the
hovel. They appear in autocracies, theocracies, aristocracies,
democracies, and ochlocracies all alike. They
change their masks somewhat from age to age and from one
form of society to another. All history is only one long
story to this effect: men have struggled for power over
their fellow-men in order that they might win the joys of
earth at the expense of others and might shift the burdens
of life from their own shoulders upon those of others. It is
true that, until this time, the proletariat, the mass of
mankind, have rarely had the power and they have not
made such a record as kings and nobles and priests have
made of the abuses they would perpetrate against their
fellow-men when they could and dared. But what folly
it is to think that vice and passion are limited by classes,
that liberty consists only in taking power away from nobles
and priests and giving it to artisans and peasants and that
these latter will never abuse it! They will abuse it just as
all others have done unless they are put under checks and
guarantees, and there can be no civil liberty anywhere
unless rights are guaranteed against all abuses, as well from
proletarians as from generals, aristocrats, and ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>Now what has been amiss in all the old arrangements?
The evils of the old military and aristocratic governments
was that some men enjoyed the fruits of other men’s labor;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
that some persons’ lives, rights, interests and happiness
were sacrificed to other persons’ cupidity and lust. What
have our ancestors been striving for, under the name of
civil liberty, for the last five hundred years? They have
been striving to bring it about that each man and woman
might live out his or her life according to his or her own
notions of happiness and up to the measure of his or her
own virtue and wisdom. How have they sought to accomplish
this? They have sought to accomplish it by setting
aside all arbitrary personal or class elements and introducing
the reign of law and the supremacy of constitutional institutions
like the jury, the habeas corpus, the independent
judiciary, the separation of church and state, and the
ballot. Note right here one point which will be important
and valuable when I come more especially to the case of
the Forgotten Man: whenever you talk of liberty, you must
have <em>two</em> men in mind. The sphere of rights of one of these
men trenches upon that of the other, and whenever you
establish liberty for the one, you repress the other. Whenever
absolute sovereigns are subjected to constitutional
restraints, you always hear them remonstrate that their
liberty is curtailed. So it is, in the sense that their power
of determining what shall be done in the state is limited
below what it was before and the similar power of other
organs in the state is widened. Whenever the privileges
of an aristocracy are curtailed, there is heard a similar
complaint. The truth is that the line of limit or demarcation
between classes as regards civil power has been moved
and what has been taken from one class is given to another.</p>

<p>We may now, then, advance a step in our conception of
civil liberty. It is the status in which we find the true
adjustment of rights between classes and individuals.
Historically, the conception of civil liberty has been constantly
changing. The notion of rights changes from one
generation to another and the conception of civil liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
changes with it. If we try to formulate a true definition of
civil liberty as an ideal thing towards which the development
of political institutions is all the time tending, it
would be this: Civil liberty is the status of the man who is
guaranteed by law and civil institutions the exclusive employment
of all his own powers for his own welfare.</p>

<p>This definition of liberty or civil liberty, you see, deals
only with concrete and actual relations of the civil order.
There is some sort of a poetical and metaphysical notion of
liberty afloat in men’s minds which some people dream
about but which nobody can define. In popular language
it means that a man may do as he has a mind to. When
people get this notion of liberty into their heads and combine
with it the notion that they live in a free country and ought
to have liberty, they sometimes make strange demands
upon the state. If liberty means to be able to do as you
have a mind to, there is no such thing in this world. Can
the Czar of Russia do as he has a mind to? Can the Pope
do as he has a mind to? Can the President of the United
States do as he has a mind to? Can Rothschild do as he
has a mind to? Could a Humboldt or a Faraday do as he
had a mind to? Could a Shakespeare or a Raphael do as
he had a mind to? Can a tramp do as he has a mind to?
Where is the man, whatever his station, possessions, or
talents, who can get any such liberty? There is none.
There is a doctrine floating about in our literature that we
are born to the inheritance of certain rights. That is another
glorious dream, for it would mean that there was
something in this world which we got for nothing. But
what is the truth? We are born into no right whatever but
what has an equivalent and corresponding duty right alongside
of it. There is no such thing on this earth as something
for nothing. Whatever we inherit of wealth, knowledge,
or institutions from the past has been paid for by the labor
and sacrifice of preceding generations; and the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
these gains are carried on, that the race lives and that the
race can, at least within some cycle, accumulate its gains,
is one of the facts on which civilization rests. The law of
the conservation of energy is not simply a law of physics;
it is a law of the whole moral universe, and the order and
truth of all things conceivable by man depends upon it.
If there were any such liberty as that of doing as you have
a mind to, the human race would be condemned to everlasting
anarchy and war as these erratic wills crossed and
clashed against each other. True liberty lies in the equilibrium
of rights and duties, producing peace, order, and
harmony. As I have defined it, it means that a man’s
right to take power and wealth out of the social product is
measured by the energy and wisdom which he has contributed
to the social effort.</p>

<p>Now if I have set this idea before you with any distinctness
and success, you see that civil liberty consists of a set
of civil institutions and laws which are arranged to act as
impersonally as possible. It does not consist in majority
rule or in universal suffrage or in elective systems at all.
These are devices which are good or better just in the
degree in which they secure liberty. The institutions of
civil liberty leave each man to run his career in life in his
own way, only guaranteeing to him that whatever he does
in the way of industry, economy, prudence, sound judgment,
etc., shall redound to his own welfare and shall not
be diverted to some one else’s benefit. Of course it is a
necessary corollary that each man shall also bear the
penalty of his own vices and his own mistakes. If I want
to be free from any other man’s dictation, I must understand
that I can have no other man under my control.</p>

<p>Now with these definitions and general conceptions in
mind, let us turn to the special class of facts to which, as
I said at the outset, I invite your attention. We see that
under a régime of liberty and equality before the law, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
get the highest possible development of independence,
self-reliance, individual energy, and enterprise, but we get
these high social virtues at the expense of the old sentimental
ties which used to unite baron and retainer, master
and servant, sage and disciple, comrade and comrade.
We are agreed that the son shall not be disgraced even by
the crime of the father, much less by the crime of a more
distant relative. It is a humane and rational view of
things that each life shall stand for itself alone and not be
weighted by the faults of another, but it is useless to deny
that this view of things is possible only in a society where
the ties of kinship have lost nearly all the intensity of
poetry and romance which once characterized them. The
ties of sentiment and sympathy also have faded out. We
have come, under the régime of liberty and equality before
the law, to a form of society which is based not on status,
but on free contract. Now a society based on status is
one in which classes, ranks, interests, industries, guilds,
associations, etc., hold men in permanent relations to each
other. Custom and prescription create, under status, ties,
the strength of which lies in sentiment. Feeble remains of
this may be seen in some of our academical societies to-day,
and it is unquestionably a great privilege and advantage
for any man in our society to win an experience of the
sentiments which belong to a strong and close association,
just because the chances for such experience are nowadays
very rare. In a society based on free contract, men come
together as free and independent parties to an agreement
which is of mutual advantage. The relation is rational,
even rationalistic. It is not poetical. It does not exist
from use and custom, but for reasons given, and it does not
endure by prescription but ceases when the reason for it
ceases. There is no sentiment in it at all. The fact is
that, under the régime of liberty and equality before the
law, there is no place for sentiment in trade or politics as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
public interests. Sentiment is thrown back into private
life, into personal relations, and if ever it comes into a
public discussion of an impersonal and general public
question it always produces mischief.</p>

<p>Now you know that “the poor and the weak” are continually
put forward as objects of public interest and public
obligation. In the appeals which are made, the terms
“the poor” and “the weak” are used as if they were terms
of exact definition. Except the pauper, that is to say,
the man who cannot earn his living or pay his way, there
is no possible definition of a poor man. Except a man who
is incapacitated by vice or by physical infirmity, there is no
definition of a weak man. The paupers and the physically
incapacitated are an inevitable charge on society. About
them no more need be said. But the weak who constantly
arouse the pity of humanitarians and philanthropists are
the shiftless, the imprudent, the negligent, the impractical,
and the inefficient, or they are the idle, the intemperate, the
extravagant, and the vicious. Now the troubles of these
persons are constantly forced upon public attention, as if
they and their interests deserved especial consideration,
and a great portion of all organized and unorganized effort
for the common welfare consists in attempts to relieve these
classes of people. I do not wish to be understood now as
saying that nothing ought to be done for these people by
those who are stronger and wiser. That is not my point.
What I want to do is to point out the thing which is overlooked
and the error which is made in all these charitable
efforts. The notion is accepted as if it were not open to
any question that if you help the inefficient and vicious you
may gain something for society or you may not, but that
you lose nothing. This is a complete mistake. Whatever
capital you divert to the support of a shiftless and good-for-nothing
person is so much diverted from some other
employment, and that means from somebody else. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
would spend any conceivable amount of zeal and eloquence
if I possessed it to try to make people grasp this idea.
Capital is force. If it goes one way it cannot go another.
If you give a loaf to a pauper you cannot give the same
loaf to a laborer. Now this other man who would have
got it but for the charitable sentiment which bestowed it
on a worthless member of society is the Forgotten Man.
The philanthropists and humanitarians have their minds
all full of the wretched and miserable whose case appeals
to compassion, attacks the sympathies, takes possession of
the imagination, and excites the emotions. They push on
towards the quickest and easiest remedies and they forget
the real victim.</p>

<p>Now who is the Forgotten Man? He is the simple,
honest laborer, ready to earn his living by productive
work. We pass him by because he is independent, self-supporting,
and asks no favors. He does not appeal to
the emotions or excite the sentiments. He only wants
to make a contract and fulfill it, with respect on both
sides and favor on neither side. He must get his living
out of the capital of the country. The larger the capital
is, the better living he can get. Every particle of capital
which is wasted on the vicious, the idle, and the shiftless is
so much taken from the capital available to reward the
independent and productive laborer. But we stand with
our backs to the independent and productive laborer all
the time. We do not remember him because he makes no
clamor; but I appeal to you whether he is not the man who
ought to be remembered first of all, and whether, on any
sound social theory, we ought not to protect him against
the burdens of the good-for-nothing. In these last years I
have read hundreds of articles and heard scores of sermons
and speeches which were really glorifications of the good-for-nothing,
as if these were the charge of society, recommended
by right reason to its care and protection. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
are addressed all the time as if those who are respectable
were to blame because some are not so, and as if there were
an obligation on the part of those who have done their
duty towards those who have not done their duty. Every
man is bound to take care of himself and his family and to
do his share in the work of society. It is totally false that
one who has done so is bound to bear the care and charge
of those who are wretched because they have not done so.
The silly popular notion is that the beggars live at the
expense of the rich, but the truth is that those who eat and
produce not, live at the expense of those who labor and
produce. The next time that you are tempted to subscribe
a dollar to a charity, I do not tell you not to do it, because
after you have fairly considered the matter, you may think
it right to do it, but I do ask you to stop and remember
the Forgotten Man and understand that if you put your
dollar in the savings bank it will go to swell the capital of
the country which is available for division amongst those
who, while they earn it, will reproduce it with increase.</p>

<p>Let us now go on to another class of cases. There are a
great many schemes brought forward for “improving the
condition of the working classes.” I have shown already
that a free man cannot take a favor. One who takes a
favor or submits to patronage demeans himself. He falls
under obligation. He cannot be free and he cannot assert
a station of equality with the man who confers the favor on
him. The only exception is where there are exceptional
bonds of affection or friendship, that is, where the sentimental
relation supersedes the free relation. Therefore,
in a country which is a free democracy, all propositions to
do something for the working classes have an air of patronage
and superiority which is impertinent and out of place. No
one can do anything for anybody else unless he has a surplus
of energy to dispose of after taking care of himself. In the
United States, the working classes, technically so called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
are the strongest classes. It is they who have a surplus to
dispose of if anybody has. Why should anybody else offer
to take care of them or to serve them? They can get whatever
they think worth having and, at any rate, if they are
free men in a free state, it is ignominious and unbecoming
to introduce fashions of patronage and favoritism here.
A man who, by superior education and experience of business,
is in a position to advise a struggling man of the
wages class, is certainly held to do so and will, I believe,
always be willing and glad to do so; but this sort of activity
lies in the range of private and personal relations.</p>

<p>I now, however, desire to direct attention to the public,
general, and impersonal schemes, and I point out the fact
that, if you undertake to lift anybody, you must have a
fulcrum or point of resistance. All the elevation you give
to one must be gained by an equivalent depression on some
one else. The question of gain to society depends upon the
balance of the account, as regards the position of the persons
who undergo the respective operations. But nearly all the
schemes for “improving the condition of the working
man” involve an elevation of some working men at the
expense of other working men. When you expend capital
or labor to elevate some persons who come within the
sphere of your influence, you interfere in the conditions of
competition. The advantage of some is won by an equivalent
loss of others. The difference is not brought about
by the energy and effort of the persons themselves. If it
were, there would be nothing to be said about it, for we
constantly see people surpass others in the rivalry of life
and carry off the prizes which the others must do without.
In the cases I am discussing, the difference is brought about
by an interference which must be partial, arbitrary, accidental,
controlled by favoritism and personal preference.
I do not say, in this case, either, that we ought to do no
work of this kind. On the contrary, I believe that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
arguments for it quite outweigh, in many cases, the arguments
against it. What I desire, again, is to bring out the
forgotten element which we always need to remember in
order to make a wise decision as to any scheme of this
kind. I want to call to mind the Forgotten Man, because,
in this case also, if we recall him and go to look for him, we
shall find him patiently and perseveringly, manfully and
independently struggling against adverse circumstances
without complaining or begging. If, then, we are led to
heed the groaning and complaining of others and to take
measures for helping these others, we shall, before we know
it, push down this man who is trying to help himself.</p>

<p>Let us take another class of cases. So far we have said
nothing about the abuse of legislation. We all seem to be
under the delusion that the rich pay the taxes. Taxes are
not thrown upon the consumers with any such directness
and completeness as is sometimes assumed; but that, in
ordinary states of the market, taxes on houses fall, for the
most part, on the tenants and that taxes on commodities
fall, for the most part, on the consumers, is beyond question.
Now the state and municipality go to great expense to
support policemen and sheriffs and judicial officers, to
protect people against themselves, that is, against the
results of their own folly, vice, and recklessness. Who
pays for it? Undoubtedly the people who have not been
guilty of folly, vice, or recklessness. Out of nothing comes
nothing. We cannot collect taxes from people who produce
nothing and save nothing. The people who have something
to tax must be those who have produced and saved.</p>

<p>When you see a drunkard in the gutter, you are disgusted,
but you pity him. When a policeman comes and
picks him up you are satisfied. You say that “society”
has interfered to save the drunkard from perishing. Society
is a fine word, and it saves us the trouble of thinking to say
that society acts. The truth is that the policeman is paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
by somebody, and when we talk about society we forget
who it is that pays. It is the Forgotten Man again. It is
the industrious workman going home from a hard day’s
work, whom you pass without noticing, who is mulcted
of a percentage of his day’s earnings to hire a policeman to
save the drunkard from himself. All the public expenditure
to prevent vice has the same effect. Vice is its own curse.
If we let nature alone, she cures vice by the most frightful
penalties. It may shock you to hear me say it, but when
you get over the shock, it will do you good to think of it:
a drunkard in the gutter is just where he ought to be.
Nature is working away at him to get him out of the way,
just as she sets up her processes of dissolution to remove
whatever is a failure in its line. Gambling and less mentionable
vices all cure themselves by the ruin and dissolution
of their victims. Nine-tenths of our measures for
preventing vice are really protective towards it, because
they ward off the penalty. “Ward off,” I say, and that is
the usual way of looking at it; but is the penalty really
annihilated? By no means. It is turned into police and
court expenses and spread over those who have resisted
vice. It is the Forgotten Man again who has been subjected
to the penalty while our minds were full of the
drunkards, spendthrifts, gamblers, and other victims of
dissipation. Who is, then, the Forgotten Man? He is the
clean, quiet, virtuous, domestic citizen, who pays his debts
and his taxes and is never heard of out of his little circle.
Yet who is there in the society of a civilized state who
deserves to be remembered and considered by the legislator
and statesman before this man?</p>

<p>Another class of cases is closely connected with this last.
There is an apparently invincible prejudice in people’s
minds in favor of state regulation. All experience is against
state regulation and in favor of liberty. The freer the
civil institutions are, the more weak or mischievous state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
regulation is. The Prussian bureaucracy can do a score of
things for the citizen which no governmental organ in the
United States can do; and, conversely, if we want to be
taken care of as Prussians and Frenchmen are, we must
give up something of our personal liberty.</p>

<p>Now we have a great many well-intentioned people
among us who believe that they are serving their country
when they discuss plans for regulating the relations of
employer and employee, or the sanitary regulations of
dwellings, or the construction of factories, or the way
to behave on Sunday, or what people ought not to eat
or drink or smoke. All this is harmless enough and well
enough as a basis of mutual encouragement and missionary
enterprise, but it is almost always made a basis
of legislation. The reformers want to get a majority,
that is, to get the power of the state and so to make
other people do what the reformers think it right and
wise to do. A and B agree to spend Sunday in a certain
way. They get a law passed to make C pass it in
their way. They determine to be teetotallers and they get
a law passed to make C be a teetotaller for the sake of D
who is likely to drink too much. Factory acts for women
and children are right because women and children are not
on an equal footing with men and cannot, therefore, make
contracts properly. Adult men, in a free state, must be
left to make their own contracts and defend themselves.
It will not do to say that some men are weak and unable to
make contracts any better than women. Our civil institutions
assume that all men are equal in political capacity and
all are given equal measure of political power and right,
which is not the case with women and children. If, then,
we measure political rights by one theory and social responsibilities
by another, we produce an immoral and vicious
relation. A and B, however, get factory acts and other
acts passed regulating the relation of employers and employee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
and set armies of commissioners and inspectors
traveling about to see to things, instead of using their
efforts, if any are needed, to lead the free men to make
their own conditions as to what kind of factory buildings
they will work in, how many hours they will work, what they
will do on Sunday and so on. The consequence is that
men lose the true education in freedom which is needed to
support free institutions. They are taught to rely on
government officers and inspectors. The whole system of
government inspectors is corrupting to free institutions.
In England, the liberals used always to regard state regulation
with suspicion, but since they have come to power,
they plainly believe that state regulation is a good thing—if
<em>they</em> regulate—because, of course, they want to bring
about good things. In this country each party takes
turns, according as it is in or out, in supporting or denouncing
the non-interference theory.</p>

<p>Now, if we have state regulation, what is always forgotten
is this: Who pays for it? Who is the victim of it?
There always is a victim. The workmen who do not
defend themselves have to pay for the inspectors who
defend them. The whole system of social regulation by
boards, commissioners, and inspectors consists in relieving
negligent people of the consequences of their negligence and
so leaving them to continue negligent without correction.
That system also turns away from the agencies which are
close, direct, and germane to the purpose, and seeks others.
Now, if you relieve negligent people of the consequences of
their negligence, you can only throw those consequences on
the people who have not been negligent. If you turn
away from the agencies which are direct and cognate to
the purpose, you can only employ other agencies. Here,
then, you have your Forgotten Man again. The man
who has been careful and prudent and who wants to go on
and reap his advantages for himself and his children is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
arrested just at that point, and he is told that he must go
and take care of some negligent employees in a factory or
on a railroad who have not provided precautions for themselves
or have not forced their employers to provide precautions,
or negligent tenants who have not taken care of
their own sanitary arrangements, or negligent householders
who have not provided against fire, or negligent parents
who have not sent their children to school. If the Forgotten
Man does not go, he must hire an inspector to go.
No doubt it is often worth his while to go or send, rather
than leave the thing undone, on account of his remoter
interest; but what I want to show is that all this is unjust
to the Forgotten Man, and that the reformers and philosophers
miss the point entirely when they preach that it is
his duty to do all this work. Let them preach to the
negligent to learn to take care of themselves. Whenever
A and B put their heads together and decide what A, B and
C must do for D, there is never any pressure on A and B.
They consent to it and like it. There is rarely any pressure
on D because he does not like it and contrives to evade it.
The pressure all comes on C. Now, who is C? He is
always the man who, if let alone, would make a reasonable
use of his liberty without abusing it. He would not constitute
any social problem at all and would not need any
regulation. He is the Forgotten Man again, and as soon as
he is brought from his obscurity you see that he is just that
one amongst us who is what we all ought to be.</p>

<p>Let us look at another case. I read again and again
arguments to prove that criminals have claims and rights
against society. Not long ago, I read an account of an
expensive establishment for the reformation of criminals,
and I am told that we ought to reform criminals, not merely
punish them vindictively. When I was a young man, I
read a great many novels by Eugene Sue, Victor Hugo,
and other Frenchmen of the school of ’48, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
badness of a bad man is represented, not as his fault, but
as the fault of society. Now, as society consists of the bad
men plus the good men, and as the object of this declaration
was to show that the badness of the bad men was not the
fault of the bad men, it remains that the badness of the
bad men must be the fault of the good men. No doubt, it
is far more consoling to the bad men than even to their
friends to reach the point of this demonstration.</p>

<p>Let us ask, now, for a moment, what is the sense of
punishment, since a good many people seem to be quite in
a muddle about it. Every man in society is bound in
nature and reason to contribute to the strength and welfare
of society. He ought to work, to be peaceful, honest, just,
and virtuous. A criminal is a man who, instead of working
with and for society, turns his efforts against the common
welfare in some way or other. He disturbs order, violates
harmony, invades the security and happiness of others,
wastes and destroys capital. If he is put to death, it is
on the ground that he has forfeited all right to existence in
society by the magnitude of his offenses against its welfare.
If he is imprisoned, it is simply a judgment of society upon
him that he is so mischievous to the society that he must
be segregated from it. His punishment is a warning to
him to reform himself, just exactly like the penalties inflicted
by God and nature on vice. A man who has committed
crime is, therefore, a burden on society and an
injury to it. He is a destructive and not a productive force
and everybody is worse off for his existence than if he did
not exist. Whence, then, does he obtain a right to be
taught or reformed at the public expense? The whole
question of what to do with him is one of expediency, and
it embraces the whole range of possible policies from that
of execution to that of education and reformation, but
when the expediency of reformatory attempts is discussed
we always forget the labor and expense and who must pay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
All that the state does for the criminal, beyond forcing him
to earn his living, is done at the expense of the industrious
member of society who never costs the state anything for
correction and discipline. If a man who has gone astray
can be reclaimed in any way, no one would hinder such a
work, but people whose minds are full of sympathy and
interest for criminals and who desire to adopt some systematic
plans of reformatory efforts are only, once more,
trampling on the Forgotten Man.</p>

<p>Let us look at another case. If there is a public office to
be filled, of course a great number of persons come forward
as candidates for it. Many of these persons are urged as
candidates on the ground that they are badly off, or that
they cannot support themselves, or that they want to earn
a living while educating themselves, or that they have
female relatives dependent on them, or for some other
reason of a similar kind. In other cases, candidates are
presented and urged on the ground of their kinship to
somebody, or on account of service, it may be meritorious
service, in some other line than that of the duty to be
performed. Men are proposed for clerkships on the ground
of service in the army twenty years ago, or for custom-house
inspectors on the ground of public services in the
organization of political parties. If public positions are
granted on these grounds of sentiment or favoritism, the
abuse is to be condemned on the ground of the harm done
to the public interest; but I now desire to point out another
thing which is constantly forgotten. If you give a position
to A, you cannot give it to B. If A is an object of sentiment
or favoritism and not a person fit and competent to
fulfill the duty, who is B? He is somebody who has nothing
but merit on his side, somebody who has no powerful
friends, no political influence, some quiet, unobtrusive
individual who has known no other way to secure the
chances of life than simply to deserve them. Here we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
the Forgotten Man again, and once again we find him worthy
of all respect and consideration, but passed by in favor of
the noisy, pushing, and incompetent. Who ever remembers
that if you give a place to a man who is unfit for it you are
keeping out of it somebody, somewhere, who is fit for it?</p>

<p>Let us take another case. A trades-union is an association
of journeymen in a certain trade which has for one of
its chief objects to raise wages in that trade. This object
can be accomplished only by drawing more capital into the
trade, or by lessening the supply of labor in it. To do the
latter, the trades-unions limit the number of apprentices
who may be admitted to the trade. In discussing this
device, people generally fix their minds on the beneficiaries
of this arrangement. It is desired by everybody that
wages should be as high as they can be under the conditions
of industry. Our minds are directed by the facts of the case
to the men who are in the trade already and are seeking
their own advantage. Sometimes people go on to notice
the effects of trades-unionism on the employers, but
although employers are constantly vexed by it, it is seen
that they soon count it into the risks of their business and
settle down to it philosophically. Sometimes people go
further then and see that, if the employer adds the trades-union
and strike risk to the other risks, he submits to it
because he has passed it along upon the public and that
the public wealth is diminished by trades-unionism, which
is undoubtedly the case. I do not remember, however,
that I have ever seen in print any analysis and observation
of trades-unionism which takes into account its effect in
another direction. The effect on employers or on the
public would not raise wages. The public pays more for
houses and goods, but that does not raise wages. The
surplus paid by the public is pure loss, because it is only
paid to cover an extra business risk of the employer. If
their trades-unions raise wages, how do they do it? They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
do it by lessening the supply of labor in the trade, and this
they do by limiting the number of apprentices. All that
is won, therefore, for those in the trade, is won at the expense
of those persons in the same class in life who want to
get into the trade but are forbidden. Like every other
monopoly, this one secures advantages for those who are
in only at a greater loss to those who are kept out. Who,
then, are those who are kept out and who are always forgotten
in all the discussions? They are the Forgotten Men
again; and what kind of men are they? They are those
young men who want to earn their living by the trade in
question. Since they select it, it is fair to suppose that
they are fit for it, would succeed at it, and would benefit
society by practicing it; but they are arbitrarily excluded
from it and are perhaps pushed down into the class of unskilled
laborers. When people talk of the success of a
trades-union in raising wages, they forget these persons
who have really, in a sense, paid the increase.</p>

<p>Let me now turn your attention to another class of cases.
I have shown how, in time past, the history of states has
been a history of selfishness, cupidity, and robbery, and I
have affirmed that now and always the problems of government
are how to deal with these same vices of human
nature. People are always prone to believe that there is
something metaphysical and sentimental about civil affairs,
but there is not. Civil institutions are constructed to
protect, either directly or indirectly, the property of men
and the honor of women against the vices and passions of
human nature. In our day and country, the problem
presents new phases, but it is there just the same as it ever
was, and the problem is only the more difficult for us because
of its new phase which prevents us from recognizing
it. In fact, our people are raving and struggling against
it in a kind of blind way, not yet having come to recognize
it. More than half of their blows, at present, are misdirected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
and fail of their object, but they will be aimed
better by and by. There is a great deal of clamor about
watering stocks and the power of combined capital, which
is not very intelligent or well-directed. The evil and abuse
which people are groping after in all these denunciations is
jobbery.</p>

<p>By jobbery I mean the constantly apparent effort to
win wealth, not by honest and independent production,
but by some sort of a scheme for extorting other people’s
product from them. A large part of our legislation consists
in making a job for somebody. Public buildings are
jobs, not always, but in most cases. The buildings are
not needed at all or are costly far beyond what is useful or
even decently luxurious. Internal improvements are jobs.
They are carried out, not because they are needed in themselves,
but because they will serve the turn of some private
interest, often incidentally that of the very legislators who
pass the appropriations for them. A man who wants a
farm, instead of going out where there is plenty of land
available for it, goes down under the Mississippi River to
make a farm, and then wants his fellow-citizens to be
taxed to dyke the river so as to keep it off his farm. The
Californian hydraulic miners have washed the gold out of
the hillsides and have washed the dirt down into the valleys
to the ruin of the rivers and the farms. They want the
federal government to remove this dirt at the national
expense. The silver miners, finding that their product is
losing value in the market, get the government to go into
the market as a great buyer in the hope of sustaining the
price. The national government is called upon to buy or
hire unsalable ships; to dig canals which will not pay;
to educate illiterates in the states which have not done
their duty at the expense of the states which have done
their duty as to education; to buy up telegraphs which no
longer pay; and to provide the capital for enterprises of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
which private individuals are to win the profits. We are
called upon to squander twenty millions on swamps and
creeks; from twenty to sixty-six millions on the Mississippi
River; one hundred millions in pensions—and there is
now a demand for another hundred million beyond that.
This is the great plan of all living on each other. The
pensions in England used to be given to aristocrats who
had political power, in order to corrupt them. Here the
pensions are given to the great democratic mass who have
the political power, in order to corrupt them. We have
one hundred thousand federal office-holders and I do not
know how many state and municipal office-holders. Of
course public officers are necessary and it is an economical
organization of society to set apart some of its members
for civil functions, but if the number of persons drawn
from production and supported by the producers while
engaged in civil functions is in undue proportion to the
total population, there is economic loss. If public offices
are treated as spoils or benefices or sinecures, then they
are jobs and only constitute part of the pillage.</p>

<p>The biggest job of all is a protective tariff. This device
consists in delivering every man over to be plundered by his
neighbor and in teaching him to believe that it is a good
thing for him and his country because he may take his turn
at plundering the rest. Mr. Kelley said that if the internal
revenue taxes on whisky and tobacco, which are paid to
the United States government, were not taken off, there
would be a rebellion. Just then it was discovered that
Sumatra tobacco was being imported, and the Connecticut
tobacco men hastened to Congress to get a tax laid on it
for their advantage. So it appears that if a tax is laid on
tobacco, to be paid to the United States, there will be a
rebellion, but if a tax is laid on it to be paid to the farmers
of the Connecticut Valley, there will be no rebellion at all.
The tobacco farmers having been taxed for protected manufactures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
are now to be taken into the system, and the
workmen in the factories are to be taxed on their tobacco
to protect the farmers. So the system is rendered more
complete and comprehensive.</p>

<p>On every hand you find this jobbery. The government
is to give every man a pension, and every man an office,
and every man a tax to raise the price of his product, and
to clean out every man’s creek for him, and to buy all his
unsalable property, and to provide him with plenty of currency
to pay his debts, and to educate his children, and to
give him the use of a library and a park and a museum and
a gallery of pictures. On every side the doors of waste and
extravagance stand open; and spend, squander, plunder,
and grab are the watchwords. We grumble some about it
and talk about the greed of corporations and the power
of capital and the wickedness of stock gambling. Yet we
elect the legislators who do all this work. Of course, we
should never think of blaming ourselves for electing men
to represent and govern us, who, if I may use a slang expression,
give us away. What man ever blamed himself for his
misfortune? We groan about monopolies and talk about
more laws to prevent the wrongs done by chartered corporations.
Who made the charters? Our representatives.
Who elected such representatives? We did. How can we
get bad law-makers to make a law which shall prevent
bad law-makers from making a bad law? That is, really,
what we are trying to do. If we are a free, self-governing
people, all our misfortunes come right home to ourselves
and we can blame nobody else. Is any one astonished to
find that men are greedy, whether they are incorporated or
not? Is it a revelation to find that we need, in our civil
affairs, to devise guarantees against selfishness, rapacity,
and fraud? I have ventured to affirm that government
has never had to deal with anything else.</p>

<p>Now, I have said that this jobbery means waste, plunder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
and loss, and I defined it at the outset as the system of
making a chance to extort part of his product from somebody
else. Now comes the question: Who pays for it all?
The system of plundering each other soon destroys all that
it deals with. It produces nothing. Wealth comes only
from production, and all that the wrangling grabbers,
loafers, and jobbers get to deal with comes from somebody’s
toil and sacrifice. Who, then, is he who provides
it all? Go and find him and you will have once more
before you the Forgotten Man. You will find him hard at
work because he has a great many to support. Nature has
done a great deal for him in giving him a fertile soil and an
excellent climate and he wonders why it is that, after all,
his scale of comfort is so moderate. He has to get out of
the soil enough to pay all his taxes, and that means the
cost of all the jobs and the fund for all the plunder. The
Forgotten Man is delving away in patient industry, supporting
his family, paying his taxes, casting his vote,
supporting the church and the school, reading his newspaper,
and cheering for the politician of his admiration, but
he is the only one for whom there is no provision in the
great scramble and the big divide.</p>

<p>Such is the Forgotten Man. He works, he votes, generally
he prays—but he always pays—yes, above all, he pays.
He does not want an office; his name never gets into the
newspaper except when he gets married or dies. He keeps
production going on. He contributes to the strength of
parties. He is flattered before election. He is strongly
patriotic. He is wanted, whenever, in his little circle,
there is work to be done or counsel to be given. He may
grumble some occasionally to his wife and family, but he
does not frequent the grocery or talk politics at the tavern.
Consequently, he is forgotten. He is a commonplace man.
He gives no trouble. He excites no admiration. He is
not in any way a hero (like a popular orator); or a problem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
(like tramps and outcasts); nor notorious (like criminals);
nor an object of sentiment (like the poor and weak); nor a
burden (like paupers and loafers); nor an object out of
which social capital may be made (like the beneficiaries of
church and state charities); nor an object for charitable
aid and protection (like animals treated with cruelty);
nor the object of a job (like the ignorant and illiterate);
nor one over whom sentimental economists and statesmen
can parade their fine sentiments (like inefficient workmen
and shiftless artisans). Therefore, he is forgotten. All
the burdens fall on him, or on her, for it is time to remember
that the Forgotten Man is not seldom a woman.</p>

<p>When you go to Willimantic, they will show you with
great pride the splendid thread mills there. I am told
that there are sewing-women who can earn only fifty cents
in twelve hours, and provide the thread. In the cost of
every spool of thread more than one cent is tax. It is paid,
not to get the thread, for you could get the thread without
it. It is paid to get the Willimantic linen company which
is not worth having and which is, in fact, a nuisance, because
it makes thread harder to get than it would be if there were
no such concern. If a woman earns fifty cents in twelve
hours, she earns a spool of thread as nearly as may be in
an hour, and if she uses a spool of thread per day, she
works a quarter of an hour per day to support the Willimantic
linen company, which in 1882 paid 95 per cent
dividend to its stockholders. If you go and look at the mill,
it will captivate your imagination until you remember all
the women in all the garrets, and all the artisans’ and
laborers’ wives and children who are spending their hours of
labor, not to get goods which they need, but to pay for the
industrial system which only stands in their way and
makes it harder for them to get the goods.</p>

<p>It is plain enough that the Forgotten Man and the
Forgotten Woman are the very life and substance of society.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
They are the ones who ought to be first and always remembered.
They are always forgotten by sentimentalists,
philanthropists, reformers, enthusiasts, and every description
of speculator in sociology, political economy, or political
science. If a student of any of these sciences ever comes
to understand the position of the Forgotten Man and to
appreciate his true value, you will find such student an
uncompromising advocate of the strictest scientific thinking
on all social topics, and a cold and hard-hearted skeptic
towards all artificial schemes of social amelioration. If it
is desired to bring about social improvements, bring us a
scheme for relieving the Forgotten Man of some of his
burdens. He is our productive force which we are wasting.
Let us stop wasting his force. Then we shall have a clean
and simple gain for the whole society. The Forgotten Man
is weighted down with the cost and burden of the schemes
for making everybody happy, with the cost of public beneficence,
with the support of all the loafers, with the loss of
all the economic quackery, with the cost of all the jobs.
Let us remember him a little while. Let us take some of
the burdens off him. Let us turn our pity on him instead
of on the good-for-nothing. It will be only justice to him,
and society will greatly gain by it. Why should we not
also have the satisfaction of thinking and caring for a
little while about the clean, honest, industrious, independent,
self-supporting men and women who have not
inherited much to make life luxurious for them, but who are
doing what they can to get on in the world without begging
from anybody, especially since all they want is to be let
alone, with good friendship and honest respect. Certainly
the philanthropists and sentimentalists have kept our
attention for a long time on the nasty, shiftless, criminal,
whining, crawling, and good-for-nothing people, as if they
alone deserved our attention.</p>

<p>The Forgotten Man is never a pauper. He almost always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
has a little capital because it belongs to the character of the
man to save something. He never has more than a little.
He is, therefore, poor in the popular sense, although in the
correct sense he is not so. I have said already that if you
learn to look for the Forgotten Man and to care for him,
you will be very skeptical toward all philanthropic and
humanitarian schemes. It is clear now that the interest
of the Forgotten Man and the interest of “the poor,” “the
weak,” and the other petted classes are in antagonism.
In fact, the warning to you to look for the Forgotten Man
comes the minute that the orator or writer begins to talk
about the poor man. That minute the Forgotten Man is
in danger of a new assault, and if you intend to meddle in
the matter at all, then is the minute for you to look about
for him and to give him your aid. Hence, if you care for
the Forgotten Man, you will be sure to be charged with
<em>not</em> caring for the poor. Whatever you do for any of the
petted classes wastes capital. If you do anything for the
Forgotten Man, you must secure him his earnings and
savings, that is, you legislate for the security of capital
and for its free employment; you must oppose paper
money, wildcat banking and usury laws and you must
maintain the inviolability of contracts. Hence you must
be prepared to be told that you favor the capitalist class,
the enemy of the poor man.</p>

<p>What the Forgotten Man really wants is true liberty.
Most of his wrongs and woes come from the fact that there
are yet mixed together in our institutions the old mediæval
theories of protection and personal dependence and the
modern theories of independence and individual liberty.
The consequence is that the people who are clever enough
to get into positions of control, measure their own rights
by the paternal theory and their own duties by the theory
of independent liberty. It follows that the Forgotten
Man, who is hard at work at home, has to pay both ways.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
His rights are measured by the theory of liberty, that is,
he has only such as he can conquer. His duties are measured
by the paternal theory, that is, he must discharge all which
are laid upon him, as is always the fortune of parents.
People talk about the paternal theory of government as if
it were a very simple thing. Analyze it, however, and you
see that in every paternal relation there must be two parties,
a parent and a child, and when you speak metaphorically,
it makes all the difference in the world who is parent and
who is child. Now, since we, the people, are the state,
whenever there is any work to be done or expense to be paid,
and since the petted classes and the criminals and the
jobbers cost and do not pay, it is they who are in the position
of the child, and it is the Forgotten Man who is the
parent. What the Forgotten Man needs, therefore, is that
we come to a clearer understanding of liberty and to a
more complete realization of it. Every step which we win
in liberty will set the Forgotten Man free from some of his
burdens and allow him to use his powers for himself and for
the commonwealth.</p>

</div>

<p>The following bibliography is as nearly exhaustive as we have
been able to make it. There are doubtless other articles which
have not come under our notice; and there are certainly a number
of contributions to the press, signed and unsigned, to which we
have no clue. The distribution of those which we have found
will indicate the task of any one who should aim at exhaustiveness.</p>

<p>It has seemed best to us to include the titles of certain unpublished
writings, especially where these are to be made accessible
to students by the deposit of the manuscripts with the Yale
University Library (under Sumner Estate). Sumner had a way
of writing something out very carefully, perhaps as a lecture, and
then laying it away with apparently no thought of publishing it;
a number of such manuscripts have been printed for the first time
in this series of volumes. There are also a few of Sumner’s
printed utterances which we possessed in the form of clippings,
but could not locate; the titles of such have been included as
accessible at the Yale Library.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of Sumner’s writing in the reports of the
Connecticut State Board of Education. We have been informed
that his services to that Board, extending over twenty years,
included much committee work and many carefully written
reports. As these are of a somewhat special nature, we refer
simply to the documents of the Board.</p>

<p>It is the intention of the publishers to make of the volumes
now in print under uniform style a set of four, to be numbered
in the order of their appearance. For the sake of brevity, then,
War and Other Essays is referred to below as Vol. I; Earth
Hunger and Other Essays, as Vol. II; The Challenge of Facts and
Other Essays, as Vol. III; and The Forgotten Man and Other
Essays, as Vol. IV.</p>

<p>There are in these volumes a few numbers not written by
Sumner, but about him, such as the Memorial Addresses in
Vol. III.</p>

from a protectionist, that a tariff between our states is, or may become, desirable.
It is from the Chicago <i>Inter-Ocean</i>, and marks the extreme limit reached, up to
this time, by protectionist fanaticism and folly, although it is thoroughly consistent,
and fairly lays bare the spirit and essence of protectionism:</p>

<p>“In the United States the present ominous and overshadowing strike in the
iron trade, by which from 75,000 to 100,000 men have been thrown out of work,
is an incisive example of the tendency of this country, also, to a condition of trade
which will compel individual states and certain sections of the country to ask for
legislation, in order to protect them against the cheaper labor and superior natural
advantage of others.” The remedy for the harm done by taxes on our foreign
trade is to lay some on our domestic trade. (See §§ <a href="#sec_26">26</a>, <a href="#sec_95">95</a>.)</p>

Minnesota to England. Nature has made man too well off. The inhabitants of
North America will not simply use their chances, but they divide into two artificial
bodies so as to try to harm each other. Millions are spent to cut an isthmus
where nature has left one, and millions more to set up a tax-barrier where nature
has made a highway.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Since the above was in type, a report from the “South American Commission”
has been received and published. This Commission submitted certain propositions
to the President of Chili on behalf of the United States. The report says:</p>

<p>“The second proposition involved the idea of a reciprocal commercial treaty
between the two countries under which special products of each should be admitted
free of duty into the other when carried under the flag of either nation.
This did not meet with any greater favor with President Santa Maria, who was
not disposed to make reciprocity treaties. His people were at liberty to sell where
they could get the best prices and buy where goods were the cheapest. In his
opinion commerce was not aided by commercial treaties, and Chili neither asked
from nor gave to other nations especial favors. Trade would regulate itself, and
there was no advantage in trying to divert it in one direction or the other. So
far as the United States was concerned, there could be very little trade with Chili,
owing to the fact that the products of the two countries were almost identical.
Chili produced very little that we wanted, and although there were many industrial
products of the United States that were used in Chili, the merchants of the latter
country must be allowed to buy where they sold and where they could trade to
the greatest advantage. With reference to the provision that reduced duties
should be allowed only upon goods carried in Chilian or American vessels, he said
that Chili did not want any such means to encourage her commerce: her ports
were open to all the vessels of the world upon an equality, and none should have
especial privileges.”—(N. Y. <cite>Times</cite>, July 3, 1885.)</p>

<p>If this is a fair specimen of the political and economic enlightenment which
prevails at the other end of the American Continent, it is a great pity that the
“Commission” is not a great deal larger. They are like the illiterate missionaries
who found themselves unawares in a theological seminary. We would do well to
send our whole Congress out there.</p>

which is no doubt true, that they cannot compete with the Swiss and German

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2 class="pgx" title="">START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
